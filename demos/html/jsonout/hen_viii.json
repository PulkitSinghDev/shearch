You ever\nHave wish'd the sleeping of this business; never desired\nIt to be stirr'd; but oft have hinder'd, oft,\nThe passages made toward it: on my honour,\nI speak my good lord cardinal to this point,\nAnd thus far clear him. Now, what moved me to't,\nI will be bold with time and your attention:\nThen mark the inducement. Thus it came; give heed to't:\nMy conscience first received a tenderness,\nScruple, and prick, on certain speeches utter'd\nBy the Bishop of Bayonne, then French ambassador;\nWho had been hither sent on the debating\nA marriage 'twixt the Duke of Orleans and\nOur daughter Mary: i' the progress of this business,\nEre a determinate resolution, he,\nI mean the bishop, did require a respite;\nWherein he might the king his lord advertise\nWhether our daughter were legitimate,\nRespecting this our marriage with the dowager,\nSometimes our brother's wife. This respite shook\nThe bosom of my conscience, enter'd me,\nYea, with a splitting power, and made to tremble\nThe region of my breast; which forced such way,\nThat many mazed considerings did throng\nAnd press'd in with this caution. First, methought\nI stood not in the smile of heaven; who had\nCommanded nature, that my lady's womb,\nIf it conceived a male child by me, should\nDo no more offices of life to't than\nThe grave does to the dead; for her male issue\nOr died where they were made, or shortly after\nThis world had air'd them: hence I took a thought,\nThis was a judgment on me; that my kingdom,\nWell worthy the best heir o' the world, should not\nBe gladded in't by me: then follows, that\nI weigh'd the danger which my realms stood in\nBy this my issue's fail; and that gave to me\nMany a groaning throe. Thus hulling in\nThe wild sea of my conscience, I did steer\nToward this remedy, whereupon we are\nNow present here together: that's to say,\nI meant to rectify my conscience,--which\nI then did feel full sick, and yet not well,--\nBy all the reverend fathers of the land\nAnd doctors learn'd: first I began in private\nWith you, my Lord of Lincoln; you remember\nHow under my oppression I did reek,\nWhen I first moved you."},{"l":"H8.2.4","s":"LINCOLN","t":"Very well, my liege."},{"l":"H8.2.4","s":"KING HENRY VIII","t":"I have spoke long: be pleased yourself to say\nHow far you satisfied me."},{"l":"H8.2.4","s":"LINCOLN","t":"So please your highness,\nThe question did at first so stagger me,\nBearing a state of mighty moment in't\nAnd consequence of dread, that I committed\nThe daring'st counsel which I had to doubt;\nAnd did entreat your highness to this course\nWhich you are running here."},{"l":"H8.2.4","s":"KING HENRY VIII","t":"I then moved you,\nMy Lord of Canterbury; and got your leave\nTo make this present summons: unsolicited\nI left no reverend person in this court;\nBut by particular consent proceeded\nUnder your hands and seals: therefore, go on:\nFor no dislike i' the world against the person\nOf the good queen, but the sharp thorny points\nOf my alleged reasons, drive this forward:\nProve but our marriage lawful, by my life\nAnd kingly dignity, we are contented\nTo wear our mortal state to come with her,\nKatharine our queen, before the primest creature\nThat's paragon'd o' the world."},{"l":"H8.2.4","s":"CARDINAL CAMPEIUS","t":"So please your highness,\nThe queen being absent, 'tis a needful fitness\nThat we adjourn this court till further day:\nMeanwhile must be an earnest motion\nMade to the queen, to call back her appeal\nShe intends unto his holiness."},{"l":"H8.2.4","s":"KING HENRY VIII","t":"Aside I may perceive\nThese cardinals trifle with me: I abhor\nThis dilatory sloth and tricks of Rome.\nMy learn'd and well-beloved servant, Cranmer,\nPrithee, return: with thy approach, I know,\nMy comfort comes along.
