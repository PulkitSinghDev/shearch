  <li data-n="1">If you shall chance, Camillo, to visit Bohemia on the like occasion whereon my services are now on foot, you shall see (as I have said) great difference betwixt our Bohemia and your Sicilia.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="CAM.">
  <li data-n="2">I think, this coming summer, the King of Sicilia means to pay Bohemia the visitation which he justly owes him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ARCH.">
  <li data-n="3">Wherein our entertainment shall shame us: we will be justified in our loves; for indeed—</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="CAM.">
  <li data-n="4">Beseech you—</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ARCH.">
  <li data-n="5">Verily, I speak it in the freedom of my knowledge: we cannot with such magnificence—in so rare—I know not what to say—We will give you sleepy drinks, that your senses (unintelligent of our insufficience) may, though they cannot praise us, as little accuse us.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="CAM.">
  <li data-n="6">You pay a great deal too dear for what’s given freely.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ARCH.">
  <li data-n="7">Believe me, I speak as my understanding instructs me, and as mine honesty puts it to utterance.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="CAM.">
  <li data-n="8">Sicilia cannot show himself overkind to 
Bohemia. They were train’d together in their childhoods; and there rooted betwixt them then such an affection, which cannot choose but branch now. Since their more mature dignities and royal necessities made separation of their society, their encounters (though not personal) hath been royally attorney’d with interchange of gifts, letters, loving embassies, that they have seem’d to be together, though absent; shook hands, as over a vast; and embrac’d as it were from the ends of oppos’d winds. The heavens continue their loves!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ARCH.">
  <li data-n="9">I think there is not in the world either malice or matter to alter it. You have an unspeakable comfort of your young prince Mamillius: it is a gentleman of the greatest promise that ever came into my note.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="CAM.">
  <li data-n="10">I very well agree with you in the hopes of him; it is a gallant child; one that, indeed, physics the subject, makes old hearts fresh. They that went on crutches ere he was born desire yet their life to see him a man.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ARCH.">
  <li data-n="11">Would they else be content to die?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="CAM.">
  <li data-n="12">Yes; if there were no other excuse why they should desire to live.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ARCH.">
  <li data-n="13">If the King had no son, they would desire to live on crutches till he had one.</li>

  <li data-n="1">Nine changes of the wat’ry star hath been</li>
  <li data-n="2">The shepherd’s note since we have left our throne</li>
  <li data-n="3">Without a burden. Time as long again</li>
  <li data-n="4">Would be fill’d up, my brother, with our thanks,</li>
  <li data-n="5">And yet we should, for perpetuity,</li>
  <li data-n="6">Go hence in debt. And therefore, like a cipher</li>
  <li data-n="7">(Yet standing in rich place), I multiply</li>
  <li data-n="8">With one “We thank you” many thousands more</li>
  <li data-n="9">That go before it.</li>

  <li data-n="9" data-o="4">Stay your thanks a while,</li>

  <li data-n="10" data-o="6">Sir, that’s tomorrow.</li>
  <li data-n="11">I am question’d by my fears of what may chance</li>

  <li data-n="13">No sneaping winds at home, to make us say,</li>
  <li data-n="14">“This is put forth too truly.” Besides, I have stay’d</li>
  <li data-n="15">To tire your royalty.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="LEON.">
  <li data-n="15" data-o="4">We are tougher, brother,</li>

<ol data-s="POL.">
  <li data-n="16" data-o="5">No longer stay.</li>

  <li data-n="17" data-o="5">Very sooth, tomorrow.</li>

<ol data-s="LEON.">
  <li data-n="18">We’ll part the time between ’s then; and in that</li>
  <li data-n="19">I’ll no gainsaying.</li>

<ol data-s="POL.">
  <li data-n="19" data-o="4">Press me not, beseech you, so.</li>
  <li data-n="20">There is no tongue that moves, none, none i’ th’ world,</li>
  <li data-n="21">So soon as yours could win me. So it should now,</li>
  <li data-n="22">Were there necessity in your request, although</li>
  <li data-n="23">’Twere needful I denied it. My affairs</li>
  <li data-n="24">Do even drag me homeward; which to hinder</li>
  <li data-n="25">Were (in your love) a whip to me; my stay,</li>
  <li data-n="26">To you a charge and trouble. To save both,</li>
  <li data-n="27">Farewell, our brother.</li>

<ol data-s="LEON.">
  <li data-n="27" data-o="4">Tongue-tied our queen? Speak you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="HER.">
  <li data-n="28">I had thought, sir, to have held my peace until</li>
  <li data-n="29">You had drawn oaths from him not to stay. You, sir,</li>
  <li data-n="30">Charge him too coldly. Tell him you are sure</li>
  <li data-n="31">All in Bohemia’s well; this satisfaction</li>
  <li data-n="32">The by-gone day proclaim’d. Say this to him,</li>
  <li data-n="33">He’s beat from his best ward.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="LEON.">
  <li data-n="33" data-o="6">Well said, Hermione.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="HER.">
  <li data-n="34">To tell he longs to see his son were strong;</li>
  <li data-n="35">But let him say so then, and let him go;</li>
  <li data-n="36">But let him swear so, and he shall not stay,</li>
  <li data-n="37">We’ll thwack him hence with distaffs.</li>
  <li data-n="38">Yet of your royal presence I’ll adventure</li>
  <li data-n="39">The borrow of a week. When at Bohemia</li>
  <li data-n="40">You take my lord, I’ll give him my commission</li>
  <li data-n="41">To let him there a month behind the gest</li>
  <li data-n="42">Prefix’d for ’s parting; yet, good deed, Leontes,</li>
  <li data-n="43">I love thee not a jar o’ th’ clock behind</li>
  <li data-n="44">What lady she her lord. You’ll stay?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="POL.">
  <li data-n="44" data-o="7">No, madam.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="HER.">
  <li data-n="45">Nay, but you will?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="POL.">
  <li data-n="45" data-o="4">I may not, verily.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="HER.">
  <li data-n="46">Verily?</li>
  <li data-n="47">You put me off with limber vows; but I,</li>
  <li data-n="48">Though you would seek t’ unsphere the stars with oaths,</li>
  <li data-n="49">Should yet say, “Sir, no going.” Verily,</li>
  <li data-n="50">You shall not go; a lady’s “verily” is</li>
  <li data-n="51">As potent as a lord’s. Will you go yet?</li>
  <li data-n="52">Force me to keep you as a prisoner,</li>
  <li data-n="53">Not like a guest: so you shall pay your fees</li>
  <li data-n="54">When you depart, and save your thanks. How say you?</li>
  <li data-n="55">My prisoner? Or my guest? By your dread “verily,”</li>
  <li data-n="56">One of them you shall be.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="POL.">
  <li data-n="56" data-o="5">Your guest then, madam.</li>
  <li data-n="57">To be your prisoner should import offending,</li>
  <li data-n="58">Which is for me less easy to commit</li>
  <li data-n="59">Than you to punish.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="HER.">
  <li data-n="59" data-o="4">Not your jailer then,</li>
  <li data-n="60">But your kind hostess. Come, I’ll question you</li>
  <li data-n="61">Of my lord’s tricks and yours when you were boys.</li>
  <li data-n="62">You were pretty lordings then?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="POL.">
  <li data-n="62" data-o="7">We were, fair queen,</li>
  <li data-n="63">Two lads that thought there was no more behind</li>
  <li data-n="64">But such a day tomorrow as today,</li>
  <li data-n="65">And to be boy eternal.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="HER.">
  <li data-n="65" data-o="5">Was not my lord</li>
  <li data-n="66">The verier wag o’ th’ two?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="POL.">
  <li data-n="67">We were as twinn’d lambs that did frisk i’ th’ sun,</li>
  <li data-n="68">And bleat the one at th’ other. What we chang’d</li>
  <li data-n="69">Was innocence for innocence; we knew not</li>
  <li data-n="70">The doctrine of ill-doing, nor dream’d</li>
  <li data-n="71">That any did. Had we pursu’d that life,</li>
  <li data-n="72">And our weak spirits ne’er been higher rear’d</li>
  <li data-n="73">With stronger blood, we should have answer’d heaven</li>
  <li data-n="74">Boldly, “Not guilty”; the imposition clear’d,</li>
  <li data-n="75">Hereditary ours.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="HER.">
  <li data-n="75" data-o="4">By this we gather</li>
  <li data-n="76">You have tripp’d since.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="POL.">
  <li data-n="76" data-o="5">O my most sacred lady,</li>
  <li data-n="77">Temptations have since then been born to ’s: for</li>
  <li data-n="78">In those unfledg’d days was my wife a girl;</li>
  <li data-n="79">Your precious self had then not cross’d the eyes</li>
  <li data-n="80">Of my young playfellow.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="HER.">
  <li data-n="80" data-o="5">Grace to boot!</li>
  <li data-n="81">Of this make no conclusion, lest you say</li>
  <li data-n="82">Your queen and I are devils. Yet go on,</li>
  <li data-n="83">Th’ offenses we have made you do we’ll answer,</li>
  <li data-n="84">If you first sinn’d with us, and that with us</li>
  <li data-n="85">You did continue fault, and that you slipp’d not</li>
  <li data-n="86">With any but with us.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="LEON.">
  <li data-n="86" data-o="4">Is he won yet?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="HER.">
  <li data-n="87">He’ll stay, my lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="LEON.">
  <li data-n="87" data-o="4">At my request he would not.</li>
  <li data-n="88">Hermione, my dearest, thou never spok’st</li>
  <li data-n="89">To better purpose.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="HER.">
  <li data-n="89" data-o="4">Never?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="LEON.">
  <li data-n="89" data-o="5">Never, but once.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="HER.">
  <li data-n="90">What? Have I twice said well? When was’t before?</li>
  <li data-n="91">I prithee tell me; cram ’s with praise, and make ’s</li>
  <li data-n="92">As fat as tame things. One good deed dying tongueless</li>
  <li data-n="93">Slaughters a thousand waiting upon that.</li>
  <li data-n="94">Our praises are our wages. You may ride ’s</li>
  <li data-n="95">With one soft kiss a thousand furlongs ere</li>
  <li data-n="96">With spur we heat an acre. But to th’ goal:</li>
  <li data-n="97">My last good deed was to entreat his stay;</li>
  <li data-n="98">What was my first? It has an elder sister,</li>
  <li data-n="99">Or I mistake you. O, would her name were Grace!</li>
  <li data-n="100">But once before I spoke to th’ purpose? When?</li>
  <li data-n="101">Nay, let me have’t; I long.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="LEON.">
  <li data-n="101" data-o="5">Why, that was when</li>
  <li data-n="102">Three crabbed months had sour’d themselves to death,</li>
  <li data-n="103">Ere I could make thee open thy white hand,</li>
  <li data-n="104">And clap thyself my love; then didst thou utter,</li>
  <li data-n="105">“I am yours forever.”</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="HER.">
  <li data-n="105" data-o="5">’Tis Grace indeed.</li>
  <li data-n="106">Why, lo you now! I have spoke to th’ purpose twice:</li>
  <li data-n="107">The one forever earn’d a royal husband;</li>
  <li data-n="108">Th’ other for some while a friend.</li>

  <li data-n="110">I have <span data-l="la">tremor cordis</span> on me; my heart dances,</li>

</ol>

<ol data-s="CAM.">
  <li data-n="2">It is fifteen years since I saw my country; though I have for the most part been air’d abroad, I desire to lay my bones there. Besides, the penitent King, my master, hath sent for me, to whose feeling sorrows I might be some allay (or I o’erween to think so), which is another spur to my departure.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="POL.">
  <li data-n="3">As thou lov’st me, Camillo, wipe not out the rest of thy services by leaving me now. The need I have of thee, thine own goodness hath made. Better not to have had thee than thus to want thee. Thou, having made me businesses which none without thee can sufficiently manage, must either stay to execute them thyself, or take away with thee the very services thou hast done; which if I have not enough consider’d (as too much I cannot), to be more thankful to thee shall be my study, and my profit therein the heaping friendships. Of that fatal country Sicilia, prithee speak no more, whose very naming punishes me with the remembrance of that penitent (as thou call’st him) and reconcil’d king, my brother, whose loss of his most precious queen and children are even now to be afresh lamented. Say to me, when saw’st thou the Prince Florizel, my son? Kings are no less unhappy, their issue not being gracious, than they are in losing them when they have approv’d their virtues.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="CAM.">
  <li data-n="4">Sir, it is three days since I saw the Prince. What his happier affairs may be, are to me unknown; but I have (missingly) noted, he is of late much retir’d from court, and is less frequent to his princely exercises than formerly he hath appear’d.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="POL.">
  <li data-n="5">I have consider’d so much, Camillo, and with some care, so far that I have eyes under my service which look upon his removedness; from whom I have this intelligence, that he is seldom from the house of a most homely shepherd, a man, they say, that from very nothing, and beyond the imagination of his neighbors, is grown into an unspeakable estate.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="CAM.">
  <li data-n="6">I have heard, sir, of such a man, who hath a daughter of most rare note. The report of her is extended more than can be thought to begin from such a cottage.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="POL.">
  <li data-n="7">That’s likewise part of my intelligence; but (I fear) the angle that plucks our son thither. Thou shalt accompany us to the place, where we will (not appearing what we are) have some question with the shepherd; from whose simplicity I think it not uneasy to get the cause of my son’s resort thither. Prithee be my present partner in this business, and lay aside the thoughts of Sicilia.</li>

Sure the gods do this year connive at us, and we may do any thing extempore. The Prince himself is about a piece of iniquity: stealing away from his father with his clog at his heels.

But what talk we of these traitorly rascals, whose miseries are to be smil’d at, their offenses being so capital? Tell me (for you seem to be honest plain men) what you have to the King. Being something gently consider’d, I’ll bring you where he is aboard, tender your persons to his presence, whisper him in your behalfs; and if it be in man besides the King to effect your suits, here is man shall do it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="CLO.">
  <li data-n="606">He seems to be of great authority. Close with him, give him gold; and though authority be a stubborn bear, yet he is oft led by the nose with gold. Show the inside of your purse to the outside of his hand, and no more ado. Remember “ston’d,” and “flay’d alive.”</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="SHEP.">
  <li data-n="607">And’t please you, sir, to undertake the business for us, here is that gold I have. I’ll make it as much more, and leave this young man in pawn till I bring it you.</li>

<div class="direction-location">
	Enter Autolycus and a Gentleman.
	
		AUT.
		1. GENT.
	
</div>

<ol data-s="AUT.">
  <li data-n="1">Beseech you, sir, were you present at this relation?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="1. GENT.">
  <li data-n="2">I was by at the opening of the fardel, heard the old shepherd deliver the manner how he found it; whereupon, after a little amazedness, we were all commanded out of the chamber; only this, methought, I heard the shepherd say, he found the child.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="AUT.">
  <li data-n="3">I would most gladly know the issue of it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="1. GENT.">
  <li data-n="4">I make a broken delivery of the business; but the changes I perceiv’d in the King and Camillo were very notes of admiration. They seem’d almost, with staring on one another, to tear the cases of their eyes. There was speech in their dumbness, language in their very gesture; they look’d as they had heard of a world ransom’d, or one destroy’d. A notable passion of wonder appear’d in them; but the wisest beholder, that knew no more but seeing, could not say if th’ importance were joy or sorrow; but in the extremity of the one, it must needs be.</li>
  <li class="direction-location">
	Enter another Gentleman.
	
		2. GENT.
	
</li>
  <li data-n="5">Here comes a gentleman that haply knows more. The news, Rogero?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="2. GENT.">
  <li data-n="6">Nothing but bonfires. The oracle is fulfill’d; the King’s daughter is found. Such a deal of wonder is broken out within this hour that ballad-makers cannot be able to express it.</li>
  <li class="direction-location">
	Enter another Gentleman.
	
		3. GENT.
	
</li>
  <li data-n="7">Here comes the Lady Paulina’s steward, he can deliver you more. How goes it now, sir? This news, which is call’d true, is so like an old tale, that the verity of it is in strong suspicion. Has the King found his heir?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="3. GENT.">
  <li data-n="8">Most true, if ever truth were pregnant by circumstance. That which you hear you’ll swear you see, there is such unity in the proofs. The mantle of Queen Hermione’s; her jewel about the neck of it; the letters of Antigonus found with it, which they know to be his character; the majesty of the creature in resemblance of the mother; the affection of nobleness which nature shows above her breeding; and many other evidences proclaim her, with all certainty, to be the King’s daughter. Did you see the meeting of the two kings?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="2. GENT.">
  <li data-n="9">No.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="3. GENT.">
  <li data-n="10">Then have you lost a sight which was to be seen, cannot be spoken of. There might you have beheld one joy crown another, so and in such manner that it seem’d sorrow wept to take leave of them, for their joy waded in tears. There was casting up of eyes, holding up of hands, with countenance of such distraction that they were to be known by garment, not by favor. Our king, being ready to leap out of himself for joy of his found daughter, as if that joy were now become a loss, cries, “O, thy mother, thy mother!”; then asks Bohemia forgiveness; then embraces his son-in-law; then again worries he his daughter with clipping her. Now he thanks the old shepherd, which stands by like a weather-bitten conduit of many kings’ reigns. I never heard of such another encounter, which lames report to follow it, and undoes description to do it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="2. GENT.">
  <li data-n="11">What, pray you, became of Antigonus, that carried hence the child?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="3. GENT.">
  <li data-n="12">Like an old tale still, which will have matter to rehearse, though credit be asleep and not an ear open: he was torn to pieces with a bear. This avouches the shepherd’s son, who has not only his innocence (which seems much) to justify him, but a handkerchief and rings of his that Paulina knows.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="1. GENT.">
  <li data-n="13">What became of his bark and his followers?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="3. GENT.">
  <li data-n="14">Wrack’d the same instant of their master’s death, and in the view of the shepherd; so that all the instruments which aided to expose the child were even then lost when it was found. But O, the noble combat that ’twixt joy and sorrow was fought in Paulina! She had one eye declin’d for the loss of her husband, another elevated that the oracle was fulfill’d. She lifted the Princess from the earth, and so locks her in embracing, as if she would pin her to her heart, that she might no more be in danger of losing.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="1. GENT.">
  <li data-n="15">The dignity of this act was worth the audience of kings and princes, for by such was it acted.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="3. GENT.">
  <li data-n="16">One of the prettiest touches of all, and that which angled for mine eyes (caught the water though not the fish), was when, at the relation of the Queen’s death (with the manner how she came to’t bravely confess’d and lamented by the King), how attentiveness wounded his daughter, till (from one sign of dolor to another) she did (with an “Alas!”), I would fain say, bleed tears; for I am sure my heart wept blood. Who was most marble there chang’d color; some swounded, all sorrow’d. If all the world could have seen’t, the woe had been universal.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="1. GENT.">
  <li data-n="17">Are they return’d to the court?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="3. GENT.">
  <li data-n="18">No. The Princess hearing of her mother’s statue, which is in the keeping of Paulina—a piece many years in doing and now newly perform’d by that rare Italian master, Julio Romano, who, had he himself eternity and could put breath into his work, would beguile Nature of her custom, so perfectly he is her ape. He so near to Hermione hath done Hermione that they say one would speak to her and stand in hope of answer. Thither with all greediness of affection are they gone, and there they intend to sup.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="2. GENT.">
  <li data-n="19">I thought she had some great matter there in hand, for she hath privately twice or thrice a day, ever since the death of Hermione, visited that remov’d house. Shall we thither, and with our company piece the rejoicing?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="1. GENT.">
  <li data-n="20">Who would be thence that has the benefit of access? Every wink of an eye some new grace will be born. Our absence makes us unthrifty to our knowledge. Let’s along.</li>

I brought the old man and his son aboard the Prince; told him I heard them talk of a fardel, and I know not what; but he at that time, overfond of the shepherd’s daughter (so he then took her to be), who began to be much sea-sick, and himself little better, extremity of weather continuing, this mystery remain’d undiscover’d.

  <li data-n="1">O grave and good Paulina, the great comfort</li>
  <li data-n="2">That I have had of thee!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="PAUL.">
  <li data-n="2" data-o="5">What, sovereign sir,</li>
  <li data-n="3">I did not well, I meant well. All my services</li>
  <li data-n="4">You have paid home; but that you have vouchsaf’d,</li>
  <li data-n="5">With your crown’d brother and these your contracted</li>
  <li data-n="6">Heirs of your kingdoms, my poor house to visit,</li>
  <li data-n="7">It is a surplus of your grace, which never</li>

</ol>

<ol data-s="LEON.">
  <li data-n="8" data-o="5">O Paulina,</li>
  <li data-n="9">We honor you with trouble; but we came</li>
  <li data-n="10">To see the statue of our queen. Your gallery</li>
  <li data-n="11">Have we pass’d through, not without much content</li>
  <li data-n="12">In many singularities; but we saw not</li>
  <li data-n="13">That which my daughter came to look upon,</li>
  <li data-n="14">The statue of her mother.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="PAUL.">
  <li data-n="14" data-o="5">As she liv’d peerless,</li>
  <li data-n="15">So her dead likeness, I do well believe,</li>
  <li data-n="16">Excels what ever yet you look’d upon,</li>
  <li data-n="17">Or hand of man hath done; therefore I keep it</li>
  <li data-n="18">Lonely, apart. But here it is; prepare</li>
  <li data-n="19">To see the life as lively mock’d as ever</li>
  <li data-n="20">Still sleep mock’d death. Behold, and say ’tis well.</li>

</li>
  <li data-n="21">I like your silence, it the more shows off</li>
  <li data-n="22">Your wonder; but yet speak. First, you, my liege;</li>
  <li data-n="23">Comes it not something near?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="LEON.">
  <li data-n="23" data-o="6">Her natural posture!</li>
  <li data-n="24">Chide me, dear stone, that I may say indeed</li>
  <li data-n="25">Thou art Hermione; or rather, thou art she</li>
  <li data-n="26">In thy not chiding; for she was as tender</li>
  <li data-n="27">As infancy and grace. But yet, Paulina,</li>
  <li data-n="28">Hermione was not so much wrinkled, nothing</li>
  <li data-n="29">So aged as this seems.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="POL.">
  <li data-n="29" data-o="4">O, not by much.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="PAUL.">
  <li data-n="30">So much the more our carver’s excellence,</li>
  <li data-n="31">Which lets go by some sixteen years, and makes her</li>
  <li data-n="32">As she liv’d now.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="LEON.">
  <li data-n="32" data-o="4">As now she might have done,</li>
  <li data-n="33">So much to my good comfort as it is</li>
  <li data-n="34">Now piercing to my soul. O, thus she stood,</li>
  <li data-n="35">Even with such life of majesty (warm life,</li>
  <li data-n="36">As now it coldly stands), when first I woo’d her!</li>
  <li data-n="37">I am asham’d; does not the stone rebuke me</li>
  <li data-n="38">For being more stone than it? O royal piece,</li>
  <li data-n="39">There’s magic in thy majesty, which has</li>
  <li data-n="40">My evils conjur’d to remembrance, and</li>
  <li data-n="41">From thy admiring daughter took the spirits,</li>
  <li data-n="42">Standing like stone with thee.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="PER.">
  <li data-n="42" data-o="6">And give me leave,</li>
  <li data-n="43">And do not say ’tis superstition, that</li>
  <li data-n="44">I kneel, and then implore her blessing. Lady,</li>
  <li data-n="45">Dear queen, that ended when I but began,</li>
  <li data-n="46">Give me that hand of yours to kiss.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="PAUL.">
  <li data-n="46" data-o="7">O, patience!</li>
  <li data-n="47">The statue is but newly fix’d; the color’s</li>
  <li data-n="48">Not dry.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="CAM.">
  <li data-n="49">My lord, your sorrow was too sore laid on,</li>
  <li data-n="50">Which sixteen winters cannot blow away,</li>
  <li data-n="51">So many summers dry. Scarce any joy</li>
  <li data-n="52">Did ever so long live; no sorrow</li>
  <li data-n="53">But kill’d itself much sooner.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="POL.">
  <li data-n="53" data-o="6">Dear my brother,</li>
  <li data-n="54">Let him that was the cause of this have pow’r</li>
  <li data-n="55">To take off so much grief from you as he</li>
  <li data-n="56">Will piece up in himself.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="PAUL.">
  <li data-n="56" data-o="5">Indeed, my lord,</li>
  <li data-n="57">If I had thought the sight of my poor image</li>
  <li data-n="58">Would thus have wrought you (for the stone is mine),</li>
  <li data-n="59">I’ld not have show’d it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="LEON.">
  <li data-n="59" data-o="5">Do not draw the curtain.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="PAUL.">
  <li data-n="60">No longer shall you gaze on’t, lest your fancy</li>
  <li data-n="61">May think anon it moves.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="LEON.">
  <li data-n="61" data-o="5">Let be, let be.</li>
  <li data-n="62">Would I were dead but that methinks already—</li>
  <li data-n="63">What was he that did make it? See, my lord,</li>
  <li data-n="64">Would you not deem it breath’d? And that those veins</li>
  <li data-n="65">Did verily bear blood?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="POL.">
  <li data-n="65" data-o="5">Masterly done!</li>
  <li data-n="66">The very life seems warm upon her lip.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="LEON.">
  <li data-n="67">The fixure of her eye has motion in’t,</li>
  <li data-n="68">As we are mock’d with art.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="PAUL.">
  <li data-n="68" data-o="5">I’ll draw the curtain.</li>
  <li data-n="69">My lord’s almost so far transported that</li>
  <li data-n="70">He’ll think anon it lives.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="LEON.">
  <li data-n="70" data-o="5">O sweet Paulina,</li>
  <li data-n="71">Make me to think so twenty years together!</li>
  <li data-n="72">No settled senses of the world can match</li>
  <li data-n="73">The pleasure of that madness. Let’t alone.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="PAUL.">
  <li data-n="74">I am sorry, sir, I have thus far stirr’d you; but</li>
  <li data-n="75">I could afflict you farther.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="LEON.">
  <li data-n="75" data-o="5">Do, Paulina;</li>
  <li data-n="76">For this affliction has a taste as sweet</li>
  <li data-n="77">As any cordial comfort. Still methinks</li>
  <li data-n="78">There is an air comes from her. What fine chisel</li>
  <li data-n="79">Could ever yet cut breath? Let no man mock me,</li>
  <li data-n="80">For I will kiss her.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="PAUL.">
  <li data-n="80" data-o="4">Good my lord, forbear.</li>
  <li data-n="81">The ruddiness upon her lip is wet;</li>
  <li data-n="82">You’ll mar it if you kiss it; stain your own</li>
  <li data-n="83">With oily painting. Shall I draw the curtain?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="LEON.">
  <li data-n="84">No! Not these twenty years.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="PER.">
  <li data-n="84" data-o="5">So long could I</li>
  <li data-n="85">Stand by, a looker-on.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="PAUL.">
  <li data-n="85" data-o="5">Either forbear,</li>
  <li data-n="86">Quit presently the chapel, or resolve you</li>
  <li data-n="87">For more amazement. If you can behold it,</li>
  <li data-n="88">I’ll make the statue move indeed, descend,</li>
  <li data-n="89">And take you by the hand; but then you’ll think</li>
  <li data-n="90">(Which I protest against) I am assisted</li>
  <li data-n="91">By wicked powers.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="LEON.">
  <li data-n="91" data-o="4">What you can make her do,</li>
  <li data-n="92">I am content to look on; what to speak,</li>
  <li data-n="93">I am content to hear; for ’tis as easy</li>
  <li data-n="94">To make her speak as move.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="PAUL.">
  <li data-n="94" data-o="5">It is requir’d</li>
  <li data-n="95">You do awake your faith. Then, all stand still.</li>
  <li data-n="96">On; those that think it is unlawful business</li>
  <li data-n="97">I am about, let them depart.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="LEON.">
  <li data-n="97" data-o="5">Proceed;</li>
  <li data-n="98">No foot shall stir.</li>

  <li data-n="101">I’ll fill your grave up. Stir; nay, come away;</li>
  <li data-n="102">Bequeath to death your numbness; for from him</li>
  <li data-n="103">Dear life redeems you. You perceive she stirs.</li>

  <li data-n="106">Until you see her die again, for then</li>
  <li data-n="107">You kill her double. Nay, present your hand.</li>
  <li data-n="108">When she was young, you woo’d her; now, in age,</li>
  <li data-n="109">Is she become the suitor?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="LEON.">
  <li data-n="109" data-o="5">O, she’s warm!</li>
  <li data-n="110">If this be magic, let it be an art</li>
  <li data-n="111">Lawful as eating.</li>

  <li data-n="114">Ay, and make it manifest where she has liv’d,</li>
  <li data-n="115">Or how stol’n from the dead.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="PAUL.">
  <li data-n="115" data-o="6">That she is living,</li>
  <li data-n="116">Were it but told you, should be hooted at</li>
  <li data-n="117">Like an old tale; but it appears she lives,</li>
  <li data-n="118">Though yet she speak not. Mark a little while.</li>
  <li data-n="119">Please you to interpose, fair madam, kneel,</li>
  <li data-n="120">And pray your mother’s blessing. Turn, good lady,</li>
  <li data-n="121">Our Perdita is found.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="HER.">
  <li data-n="121" data-o="4">You gods, look down</li>
  <li data-n="122">And from your sacred vials pour your graces</li>

  <li data-n="124">Where hast thou been preserv’d? Where liv’d? How found</li>

  <li data-n="127">Gave hope thou wast in being, have preserv’d</li>
  <li data-n="128">Myself to see the issue.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="PAUL.">
  <li data-n="128" data-o="5">There’s time enough for that;</li>
  <li data-n="129">Least they desire (upon this push) to trouble</li>
  <li data-n="130">Your joys with like relation. Go together,</li>
  <li data-n="131">You precious winners all; your exultation</li>

  <li data-n="134">My mate (that’s never to be found again)</li>
  <li data-n="135">Lament till I am lost.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="LEON.">
  <li data-n="135" data-o="4">O, peace, Paulina!</li>
  <li data-n="136">Thou shouldst a husband take by my consent,</li>
  <li data-n="137">As I by thine a wife: this is a match,</li>
  <li data-n="138">And made between ’s by vows. Thou hast found mine,</li>
  <li data-n="139">But how, is to be question’d; for I saw her</li>
  <li data-n="140">(As I thought) dead; and have (in vain) said many</li>
  <li data-n="141">A prayer upon her grave. I’ll not seek far</li>
  <li data-n="142">(For him, I partly know his mind) to find thee</li>

  <li data-n="147">What? Look upon my brother. Both your pardons,</li>
  <li data-n="148">That e’er I put between your holy looks</li>
  <li data-n="149">My ill suspicion. This’ your son-in-law,</li>
