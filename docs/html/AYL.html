<h3>Scene 1</h3>

<h4 class="direction-location">An orchard of Oliver’s house.</h4>

	Enter Orlando and Adam.

<ol data-s="ORL.">
  <li data-n="1">As I remember, Adam, it was upon this fashion bequeath’d me by will but poor a thousand crowns, and, as thou say’st, charg’d my brother, on his blessing, to breed me well; and there begins my sadness. My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and report speaks goldenly of his profit. For my part, he keeps me rustically at home, or (to speak more properly) stays me here at home unkept; for call you that keeping for a gentleman of my birth, that differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses are bred better, for besides that they are fair with their feeding, they are taught their manage, and to that end riders dearly hir’d; but I (his brother) gain nothing under him but growth, for the which his animals on his dunghills are as much bound to him as I. Besides this nothing that he so plentifully gives me, the something that nature gave me his countenance seems to take from me. He lets me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a brother, and as much as in him lies, mines my gentility with my education. This is it, Adam, that grieves me, and the spirit of my father, which I think is within me, begins to mutiny against this servitude. I will no longer endure it, though yet I know no wise remedy how to avoid it.</li>

<ol data-s="ORL.">
  <li data-n="3">Go apart, Adam, and thou shalt hear how he will shake me up.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="OLIV.">
  <li data-n="4">Now, sir, what make you here?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ORL.">
  <li data-n="5">Nothing. I am not taught to make any thing.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="OLIV.">
  <li data-n="6">What mar you then, sir?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ORL.">
  <li data-n="7">Marry, sir, I am helping you to mar that which God made, a poor unworthy brother of yours, with idleness.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="OLIV.">
  <li data-n="8">Marry, sir, be better employ’d, and be naught a while.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ORL.">
  <li data-n="9">Shall I keep your hogs and eat husks with them? What prodigal portion have I spent, that I should come to such penury?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="OLIV.">
  <li data-n="10">Know you where you are, sir?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ORL.">
  <li data-n="11">O, sir, very well; here in your orchard.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="OLIV.">
  <li data-n="12">Know you before whom, sir?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ORL.">
  <li data-n="13">Ay, better than him I am before knows me. I know you are my eldest brother, and in the gentle condition of blood you should so know me. The courtesy of nations allows you my better, in that you are the first born, but the same tradition takes not away my blood, were there twenty brothers betwixt us. I have as much of my father in me as you, albeit I confess your coming before me is nearer to his reverence.</li>

<ol data-s="OLIV.">
  <li data-n="16">Wilt thou lay hands on me, villain?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ORL.">
  <li data-n="17">I am no villain; I am the youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys. He was my father, and he is thrice a villain that says such a father begot villains. Wert thou not my brother, I would not take this hand from thy throat till this other had pull’d out thy tongue for saying so. Thou hast rail’d on thyself.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ADAM.">
  <li data-n="18">Sweet masters, be patient, for your father’s remembrance, be at accord.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="OLIV.">
  <li data-n="19">Let me go, I say.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ORL.">
  <li data-n="20">I will not till I please. You shall hear me. My father charg’d you in his will to give me good education. You have train’d me like a peasant, obscuring and hiding from me all gentleman-like qualities. The spirit of my father grows strong in me, and I will no longer endure it; therefore allow me such exercises as may become a gentleman, or give me the poor allottery my father left me by testament, with that I will go buy my fortunes.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="OLIV.">
  <li data-n="21">And what wilt thou do? Beg, when that is spent? Well, sir, get you in. I will not long be troubled with you; you shall have some part of your will. I pray you leave me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ORL.">
  <li data-n="22">I will no further offend you than becomes me for my good.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="OLIV.">
  <li data-n="23">Get you with him, you old dog.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ADAM.">
  <li data-n="24">Is “old dog” my reward? Most true, I have lost my teeth in your service. God be with my old master, he would not have spoke such a word.</li>

	Enter Charles.
	
		CHA.
	
</div>

<ol data-s="CHA.">
  <li data-n="31">Good morrow to your worship.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="OLIV.">
  <li data-n="32">Good <span class="foreign" title="French">Monsieur</span> Charles, what’s the new news at the new court?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="CHA.">
  <li data-n="33">There’s no news at the court, sir, but the old news: that is, the old Duke is banish’d by his younger brother the new Duke, and three or four loving lords have put themselves into voluntary exile with him, whose lands and revenues enrich the new Duke; therefore he gives them good leave to wander.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="OLIV.">
  <li data-n="34">Can you tell if Rosalind, the Duke’s daughter, be banish’d with her father?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="CHA.">
  <li data-n="35">O no; for the Duke’s daughter, her cousin, so loves her, being ever from their cradles bred together, that she would have follow’d her exile, or have died to stay behind her. She is at the court, and no less belov’d of her uncle than his own daughter, and never two ladies lov’d as they do.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="OLIV.">
  <li data-n="36">Where will the old Duke live?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="CHA.">
  <li data-n="37">They say he is already in the forest of Arden, and a many merry men with him; and there they live like the old Robin Hood of England. They say many young gentlemen flock to him every day, and fleet the time carelessly, as they did in the golden world.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="OLIV.">
  <li data-n="38">What, you wrestle tomorrow before the new Duke?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="CHA.">
  <li data-n="39">Marry, do I, sir; and I came to acquaint you with a matter. I am given, sir, secretly to understand that your younger brother, Orlando, hath a disposition to come in disguis’d against me to try a fall. Tomorrow, sir, I wrestle for my credit, and he that escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him well. Your brother is but young and tender, and for your love I would be loath to foil him, as I must for my own honor if he come in; therefore out of my love to you, I came hither to acquaint you withal, that either you might stay him from his intendment, or brook such disgrace well as he shall run into, in that it is a thing of his own search, and altogether against my will.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="OLIV.">
  <li data-n="40">Charles, I thank thee for thy love to me, which thou shalt find I will most kindly requite. I had myself notice of my brother’s purpose herein, and have by underhand means labor’d to dissuade him from it; but he is resolute. I’ll tell thee, Charles, it is the stubbornest young fellow of France, full of ambition, an envious emulator of every man’s good parts, a secret and villainous contriver against me his natural brother; therefore use thy discretion— I had as lief thou didst break his neck as his finger. And thou wert best look to’t; for if thou dost him any slight disgrace, or if he do not mightily grace himself on thee, he will practice against thee by poison, entrap thee by some treacherous device, and never leave thee till he hath ta’en thy life by some indirect means or other; for I assure thee (and almost with tears I speak it) there is not one so young and so villainous this day living. I speak but brotherly of him, but should I anatomize him to thee as he is, I must blush and weep, and thou must look pale and wonder.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="CHA.">
  <li data-n="41">I am heartily glad I came hither to you. If he come tomorrow, I’ll give him his payment. If ever he go alone again, I’ll never wrestle for prize more. And so God keep your worship!</li>
</ol>

<div class="direction-location">
	Exit.
	
		CHA.
	
</div>

<ol data-s="OLIV.">
  <li data-n="42">Farewell, good Charles. Now will I stir this gamester. I hope I shall see an end of him; for my soul (yet I know not why) hates nothing more than he. Yet he’s gentle, never school’d and yet learned, full of noble device, of all sorts enchantingly belov’d, and indeed so much in the heart of the world, and especially of my own people, who best know him, that I am altogether mispris’d. But it shall not be so long, this wrestler shall clear all. Nothing remains but that I kindle the boy thither, which now I’ll go about.</li>

<h3>Scene 2</h3>

<h4 class="direction-location">A lawn before the Duke’s palace.</h4>

<div class="direction-location">
	Enter Rosalind and Celia.
	
		ROS.
		CEL.
	
</div>

<ol data-s="CEL.">
  <li data-n="1">I pray thee, Rosalind, sweet my coz, be merry.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ROS.">
  <li data-n="2">Dear Celia—I show more mirth than I am mistress of, and would you yet I were merrier? Unless you could teach me to forget a banish’d father, you must not learn me how to remember any extraordinary pleasure.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="CEL.">
  <li data-n="3">Herein I see thou lov’st me not with the full weight that I love thee. If my uncle, thy banish’d father, had banish’d thy uncle, the Duke my father, so thou hadst been still with me, I could have taught my love to take thy father for mine; so wouldst thou, if the truth of thy love to me were so righteously temper’d as mine is to thee.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ROS.">
  <li data-n="4">Well, I will forget the condition of my estate, to rejoice in yours.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="CEL.">
  <li data-n="5">You know my father hath no child but I, nor none is like to have; and truly when he dies, thou shalt be his heir; for what he hath taken away from thy father perforce, I will render thee again in affection. By mine honor, I will, and when I break that oath, let me turn monster. Therefore, my sweet Rose, my dear Rose, be merry.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ROS.">
  <li data-n="6">From henceforth I will, coz, and devise sports. Let me see—what think you of falling in love?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="CEL.">
  <li data-n="7">Marry, I prithee do, to make sport withal. But love no man in good earnest, nor no further in sport neither, than with safety of a pure blush thou mayst in honor come off again.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ROS.">
  <li data-n="8">What shall be our sport then?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="CEL.">
  <li data-n="9">Let us sit and mock the good huswife Fortune from her wheel, that her gifts may henceforth be bestow’d equally.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ROS.">
  <li data-n="10">I would we could do so; for her benefits are mightily misplac’d, and the bountiful blind woman doth most mistake in her gifts to women.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="CEL.">
  <li data-n="11">’Tis true, for those that she makes fair she scarce makes honest, and those that she makes honest she makes very ill-favoredly.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ROS.">
  <li data-n="12">Nay, now thou goest from Fortune’s office to Nature’s. Fortune reigns in gifts of the world, not in the lineaments of Nature.</li>
</ol>

<div class="direction-location">
	Enter Clown (Touchstone).
	
		TOUCH.
	
</div>

<ol data-s="CEL.">
  <li data-n="13">No; when Nature hath made a fair creature, may she not by Fortune fall into the fire? Though Nature hath given us wit to flout at Fortune, hath not Fortune sent in this fool to cut off the argument?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ROS.">
  <li data-n="14">Indeed there is Fortune too hard for Nature, when Fortune makes Nature’s natural the cutter-off of Nature’s wit.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="CEL.">
  <li data-n="15">Peradventure this is not Fortune’s work neither, but Nature’s, who perceiveth our natural wits too dull to reason of such goddesses, and hath sent this natural for our whetstone; for always the dullness of the fool is the whetstone of the wits. How now, wit, whither wander you?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="TOUCH.">
  <li data-n="16">Mistress, you must come away to your father.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="CEL.">
  <li data-n="17">Were you made the messenger?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="TOUCH.">
  <li data-n="18">No, by mine honor, but I was bid to come for you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ROS.">
  <li data-n="19">Where learn’d you that oath, fool?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="TOUCH.">
  <li data-n="20">Of a certain knight, that swore by his honor they were good pancakes, and swore by his honor the mustard was naught. Now I’ll stand to it, the pancakes were naught, and the mustard was good, and yet was not the knight forsworn.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="CEL.">
  <li data-n="21">How prove you that, in the great heap of your knowledge?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ROS.">
  <li data-n="22">Ay, marry, now unmuzzle your wisdom.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="TOUCH.">
  <li data-n="23">Stand you both forth now. Stroke your chins, and swear by your beards that I am a knave.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="CEL.">
  <li data-n="24">By our beards (if we had them) thou art.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="TOUCH.">
  <li data-n="25">By my knavery (if I had it) then I were. But if you swear by that that is not, you are not forsworn. No more was this knight, swearing by his honor, for he never had any; or if he had, he had sworn it away before ever he saw those pancakes or that mustard.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="CEL.">
  <li data-n="26">Prithee, who is’t that thou mean’st?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="TOUCH.">
  <li data-n="27">One that old Frederick, your father, loves.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="CEL.">
  <li data-n="28">My father’s love is enough to honor him enough. Speak no more of him, you’ll be whipt for taxation one of these days.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="TOUCH.">
  <li data-n="29">The more pity that fools may not speak wisely what wise men do foolishly.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="CEL.">
  <li data-n="30">By my troth, thou sayest true; for since the little wit that fools have was silenc’d, the little foolery that wise men have makes a great show. Here comes <span class="foreign" title="French">Monsieur</span> Le Beau.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="LE BEAU.">
  <li data-n="45">I will tell you the beginning; and if it please your ladyships, you may see the end, for the best is yet to do, and here where you are, they are coming to perform it.</li>

  <li data-n="46">Well, the beginning, that is dead and buried.</li>

<ol data-s="LE BEAU.">
  <li data-n="47">There comes an old man and his three sons—</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="CEL.">
  <li data-n="48">I could match this beginning with an old tale.</li>

<ol data-s="LE BEAU.">
  <li data-n="51">The eldest of the three wrestled with Charles, the Duke’s wrestler, which Charles in a moment threw him, and broke three of his ribs, that there is little hope of life in him. So he serv’d the second, and so the third. Yonder they lie, the poor old man, their father, making such pitiful dole over them that all the beholders take his part with weeping.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ROS.">
  <li data-n="52">Alas!</li>

  <li data-n="53">But what is the sport, monsieur, that the ladies have lost?</li>

  <li data-n="54">Why, this that I speak of.</li>

<ol data-s="TOUCH.">
  <li data-n="55">Thus men may grow wiser every day. It is the first time that ever I heard breaking of ribs was sport for ladies.</li>

<ol data-s="ROS.">
  <li data-n="57">But is there any else longs to see this broken music in his sides? Is there yet another dotes upon rib-breaking? Shall we see this wrestling, cousin?</li>

  <li data-n="32">Under an oak, whose antique root peeps out</li>
  <li data-n="33">Upon the brook that brawls along this wood,</li>
  <li data-n="34">To the which place a poor sequest’red stag,</li>
  <li data-n="35">That from the hunter’s aim had ta’en a hurt,</li>
  <li data-n="36">Did come to languish; and indeed, my lord,</li>
  <li data-n="37">The wretched animal heav’d forth such groans</li>
  <li data-n="38">That their discharge did stretch his leathern coat</li>
  <li data-n="39">Almost to bursting, and the big round tears</li>
  <li data-n="40">Cours’d one another down his innocent nose</li>
  <li data-n="41">In piteous chase; and thus the hairy fool,</li>
  <li data-n="42">Much marked of the melancholy Jaques,</li>
  <li data-n="43">Stood on th’ extremest verge of the swift brook,</li>
  <li data-n="44">Augmenting it with tears.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="DUKE S.">
  <li data-n="45">But what said Jaques?</li>
  <li data-n="46">Did he not moralize this spectacle?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="1. LORD. ARD.">
  <li data-n="47">O yes, into a thousand similes.</li>
  <li data-n="48">First, for his weeping into the needless stream:</li>
  <li data-n="49">“Poor deer,” quoth he, “thou mak’st a testament</li>
  <li data-n="50">As worldlings do, giving thy sum of more</li>
  <li data-n="51">To that which had too much.” Then being there alone,</li>
  <li data-n="52">Left and abandoned of his velvet friends</li>
  <li data-n="53">“’Tis right,” quoth he, “thus misery doth part</li>
  <li data-n="54">The flux of company.” Anon a careless herd,</li>
  <li data-n="55">Full of the pasture, jumps along by him</li>
  <li data-n="56">And never stays to greet him. “Ay,” quoth Jaques,</li>
  <li data-n="57">“Sweep on, you fat and greasy citizens,</li>
  <li data-n="58">’Tis just the fashion. Wherefore do you look</li>
  <li data-n="59">Upon that poor and broken bankrupt there?”</li>
  <li data-n="60">Thus most invectively he pierceth through</li>
  <li data-n="61">The body of the country, city, court,</li>
  <li data-n="62">Yea, and of this our life, swearing that we</li>
  <li data-n="63">Are mere usurpers, tyrants, and what’s worse,</li>
  <li data-n="64">To fright the animals and to kill them up</li>
  <li data-n="65">In their assign’d and native dwelling-place.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="DUKE S.">
  <li data-n="66">And did you leave him in this contemplation?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="2. LORD. ARD.">
  <li data-n="67">We did, my lord, weeping and commenting</li>
  <li data-n="68">Upon the sobbing deer.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="DUKE S.">
  <li data-n="69">Show me the place.</li>
  <li data-n="70">I love to cope him in these sullen fits,</li>

  <li data-n="16">Why, what’s the matter?</li>

<ol data-s="ADAM.">
  <li data-n="16" data-o="5">O unhappy youth,</li>
  <li data-n="17">Come not within these doors! Within this roof</li>
  <li data-n="18">The enemy of all your graces lives.</li>
  <li data-n="19">Your brother—no, no brother, yet the son</li>

  <li data-n="21">Of him I was about to call his father—</li>

  <li data-n="45">Be comfort to my age! Here is the gold,</li>
  <li data-n="46">All this I give you, let me be your servant.</li>
  <li data-n="47">Though I look old, yet I am strong and lusty;</li>
  <li data-n="48">For in my youth I never did apply</li>

  <li data-n="59">Thou art not for the fashion of these times,</li>

  <li data-n="62">Even with the having. It is not so with thee.</li>
  <li data-n="63">But, poor old man, thou prun’st a rotten tree,</li>
  <li data-n="64">That cannot so much as a blossom yield</li>
  <li data-n="65">In lieu of all thy pains and husbandry.</li>
  <li data-n="66">But come thy ways, we’ll go along together,</li>
  <li data-n="67">And ere we have thy youthful wages spent,</li>
  <li data-n="68">We’ll light upon some settled low content.</li>

<ol data-s="ADAM.">
  <li data-n="69">Master, go on, and I will follow thee</li>
  <li data-n="70">To the last gasp, with truth and loyalty.</li>
  <li data-n="71">From seventeen years till now almost fourscore</li>
  <li data-n="72">Here lived I, but now live here no more.</li>
  <li data-n="73">At seventeen years many their fortunes seek,</li>

<ol data-s="JAQ.">
  <li data-n="12">A fool, a fool! I met a fool i’ th’ forest,</li>
  <li data-n="13">A motley fool. A miserable world!</li>
  <li data-n="14">As I do live by food, I met a fool,</li>
  <li data-n="15">Who laid him down, and bask’d him in the sun,</li>
  <li data-n="16">And rail’d on Lady Fortune in good terms,</li>
  <li data-n="17">In good set terms, and yet a motley fool.</li>
  <li data-n="18">“Good morrow, fool,” quoth I. “No, sir,” quoth he,</li>
  <li data-n="19">“Call me not fool till heaven hath sent me fortune.”</li>
  <li data-n="20">And then he drew a dial from his poke,</li>
  <li data-n="21">And looking on it, with lack-lustre eye,</li>
  <li data-n="22">Says very wisely, “It is ten a’ clock.</li>
  <li data-n="23">Thus we may see,” quoth he, “how the world wags.</li>
  <li data-n="24">’Tis but an hour ago since it was nine,</li>
  <li data-n="25">And after one hour more ’twill be eleven,</li>
  <li data-n="26">And so from hour to hour, we ripe and ripe,</li>
  <li data-n="27">And then from hour to hour, we rot and rot;</li>
  <li data-n="28">And thereby hangs a tale.” When I did hear</li>
  <li data-n="29">The motley fool thus moral on the time,</li>
  <li data-n="30">My lungs began to crow like chanticleer,</li>
  <li data-n="31">That fools should be so deep contemplative;</li>
  <li data-n="32">And I did laugh sans intermission</li>
  <li data-n="33">An hour by his dial. O noble fool!</li>
  <li data-n="34">A worthy fool! Motley’s the only wear.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="DUKE S.">

<ol data-s="JAQ.">
  <li data-n="36">O worthy fool! One that hath been a courtier,</li>
  <li data-n="37">And says, if ladies be but young and fair,</li>
  <li data-n="38">They have the gift to know it; and in his brain,</li>
  <li data-n="39">Which is as dry as the remainder biscuit</li>
  <li data-n="40">After a voyage, he hath strange places cramm’d</li>
  <li data-n="41">With observation, the which he vents</li>

  <li data-n="44" data-o="4">It is my only suit—</li>

  <li data-n="50">And they that are most galled with my folly,</li>
  <li data-n="51">They most must laugh. And why, sir, must they so?</li>
  <li data-n="52">The why is plain as way to parish church:</li>
  <li data-n="53">He that a fool doth very wisely hit</li>
  <li data-n="54">Doth very foolishly, although he smart,</li>
  <li data-n="55">Not to seem senseless of the bob; if not,</li>
  <li data-n="56">The wise man’s folly is anatomiz’d</li>
  <li data-n="57">Even by the squand’ring glances of the fool.</li>
  <li data-n="58">Invest me in my motley; give me leave</li>

Now in respect it is in the fields, it pleaseth me well; but in respect it is not in the court, it is tedious. As it is a spare life (look you) it fits my humor well; but as there is no more plenty in it, it goes much against my stomach. Hast any philosophy in thee, shepherd?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="COR.">
  <li data-n="13">No more but that I know the more one sickens the worse at ease he is; and that he that wants money, means, and content is without three good friends; that the property of rain is to wet and fire to burn; that good pasture makes fat sheep; and that a great cause of the night is lack of the sun; that he that hath learn’d no wit by nature, nor art, may complain of good breeding, or comes of a very dull kindred.</li>

  <li data-n="14">Such a one is a natural philosopher. Wast ever in court, shepherd?</li>

  <li data-n="15">No, truly.</li>

  <li data-n="17">Nay, I hope.</li>

  <li data-n="18">Truly, thou art damn’d, like an ill-roasted egg, all on one side.</li>

<ol data-s="COR.">
  <li data-n="19">For not being at court? Your reason.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="TOUCH.">
  <li data-n="20">Why, if thou never wast at court, thou never saw’st good manners; if thou never saw’st good manners, then thy manners must be wicked, and wickedness is sin, and sin is damnation. Thou art in a parlous state, shepherd.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="COR.">
  <li data-n="21">Not a whit, Touchstone. Those that are good manners at the court are as ridiculous in the country as the behavior of the country is most mockable at the court. You told me you salute not at the court but you kiss your hands; that courtesy would be uncleanly if courtiers were shepherds.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="TOUCH.">
  <li data-n="22">Instance, briefly; come, instance.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="COR.">
  <li data-n="23">Why, we are still handling our ewes, and their fells you know are greasy.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="TOUCH.">
  <li data-n="24">Why, do not your courtier’s hands sweat? And is not the grease of a mutton as wholesome as the sweat of a man? Shallow, shallow. A better instance, I say; come.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="COR.">
  <li data-n="25">Besides, our hands are hard.</li>

<ol data-s="TOUCH.">
  <li data-n="26">Your lips will feel them the sooner. Shallow again. A more sounder instance, come.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="COR.">
  <li data-n="27">And they are often tarr’d over with the surgery of our sheep; and would you have us kiss tar? The courtier’s hands are perfum’d with civet.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="TOUCH.">
  <li data-n="28">Most shallow man! Thou worm’s-meat, in respect of a good piece of flesh indeed! Learn of the wise, and perpend: civet is of a baser birth than tar, the very uncleanly flux of a cat. Mend the instance, shepherd.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="COR.">
  <li data-n="29">You have too courtly a wit for me, I’ll rest.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="TOUCH.">
  <li data-n="30">Wilt thou rest damn’d? God help thee, shallow man! God make incision in thee, thou art raw.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="COR.">
  <li data-n="31">Sir, I am a true laborer: I earn that I eat, get that I wear, owe no man hate, envy no man’s happiness, glad of other men’s good, content with my harm, and the greatest of my pride is to see my ewes graze and my lambs suck.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="TOUCH.">
  <li data-n="32">That is another simple sin in you, to bring the ewes and the rams together, and to offer to get your living by the copulation of cattle; to be bawd to a bell-wether, and to betray a she-lamb of a twelvemonth to a crooked-pated old cuckoldly ram, out of all reasonable match. If thou beest not damn’d for this, the devil himself will have no shepherds; 
I cannot see else how thou shouldst scape.</li>

</ol>

<ol data-s="ROS.">
  <li data-n="183">There were none principal, they were all like one another as halfpence are, every one fault seeming monstrous till his fellow-fault came to match it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ORL.">
  <li data-n="184">I prithee recount some of them.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ROS.">
  <li data-n="185">No; I will not cast away my physic but on those that are sick. There is a man haunts the forest, that abuses our young plants with carving ’Rosalind’ on their barks; hangs odes upon hawthorns, and elegies on brambles; all, forsooth, deifying the name of Rosalind. If I could meet that fancy-monger, I would give him some good counsel, for he seems to have the quotidian of love upon him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ORL.">
  <li data-n="186">I am he that is so love-shak’d, I pray you tell me your remedy.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ROS.">
  <li data-n="187">There is none of my uncle’s marks upon you. He taught me how to know a man in love; in which cage of rushes I am sure you are not prisoner.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ORL.">
  <li data-n="188">What were his marks?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ROS.">
  <li data-n="189">A lean cheek, which you have not; a blue eye and sunken, which you have not; an unquestionable spirit, which you have not; a beard neglected, which you have not (but I pardon you for that, for simply your having in beard is a younger brother’s revenue); then your hose should be ungarter’d, your bonnet unbanded, your sleeve unbutton’d, your shoe untied, and every thing about you demonstrating a careless desolation. But you are no such man; you are rather point-device in your accoustrements, as loving yourself, than seeming the lover of any other.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ORL.">
  <li data-n="190">Fair youth, I would I could make thee believe I love.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ROS.">
  <li data-n="191">Me believe it? You may as soon make her that you love believe it, which I warrant she is apter to do than to confess she does. That is one of the points in the which women still give the lie to their consciences. But in good sooth, are you he that hangs the verses on the trees, wherein Rosalind is so admir’d?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ORL.">
  <li data-n="192">I swear to thee, youth, by the white hand of Rosalind, I am that he, that unfortunate he.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ROS.">
  <li data-n="193">But are you so much in love as your rhymes speak?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ORL.">
  <li data-n="194">Neither rhyme nor reason can express how much.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ROS.">
  <li data-n="195">Love is merely a madness, and I tell you, deserves as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do; and the reason why they are not so punish’d and cur’d is, that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers are in love too. Yet I profess curing it by counsel.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ORL.">
  <li data-n="196">Did you ever cure any so?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ROS.">
  <li data-n="197">Yes, one, and in this manner. He was to imagine me his love, his mistress; and I set him every day to woo me. At which time would I, being but a moonish youth, grieve, be effeminate, changeable, longing and liking, proud, fantastical, apish, shallow, inconstant, full of tears, full of smiles; for every passion something, and for no passion truly any thing, as boys and women are for the most part cattle of this color; would now like him, now loathe him; then entertain him, then forswear him; now weep for him, then spit at him; that I drave my suitor from his mad humor of love to a living humor of madness, which was, to forswear the full stream of the world, and to live in a nook merely monastic. And thus I cur’d him, and this way will I take upon me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheep’s heart, that there shall not be one spot of love in’t.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ORL.">
  <li data-n="198">I would not be cur’d, youth.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ROS.">
  <li data-n="199">I would cure you, if you would but call me Rosalind, and come every day to my cote and woo me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ORL.">
  <li data-n="200">Now, by the faith of my love, I will. Tell me where it is.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ROS.">
  <li data-n="201">Go with me to it, and I’ll show it you; and by the way, you shall tell me where in the forest you live. Will you go?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ORL.">
  <li data-n="202">With all my heart, good youth.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ROS.">
  <li data-n="203">Nay, you must call me Rosalind. Come, sister, will you go?</li>

  <li data-n="6">I do not know what ‘poetical’ is. Is it honest in deed and word? Is it a true thing?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="TOUCH.">
  <li data-n="7">No, truly; for the truest poetry is the most feigning, and lovers are given to poetry; and what they swear in poetry may be said as lovers they do feign.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="AUD.">
  <li data-n="8">Do you wish then that the gods had made me poetical?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="TOUCH.">

  <li data-n="10">Would you not have me honest?</li>

</ol>

<ol data-s="TOUCH.">
  <li data-n="14">Truly, and to cast away honesty upon a foul slut were to put good meat into an unclean dish.</li>

  <li data-n="19">Amen. A man may, if he were of a fearful heart, stagger in this attempt; for here we have no temple but the wood, no assembly but horn-beasts. But what though? Courage! As horns are odious, they are necessary. It is said, “Many a man knows no end of his goods.” Right! Many a man has good horns, and knows no end of them. Well, that is the dowry of his wife, ’tis none of his own getting. Horns? Even so. Poor men alone? No, no, the noblest deer hath them as huge as the rascal. Is the single man therefore bless’d? No, as a wall’d town is more worthier than a village, so is the forehead of a married man more honorable than the bare brow of a bachelor; and by how much defense is better than no skill, by so much is a horn more precious than to want.</li>

  <li data-n="28">And will you (being a man of your breeding) be married under a bush like a beggar? Get you to church, and have a good priest that can tell you what marriage is.

<ol data-s="PHE.">
  <li data-n="79" data-o="3">Hah! What say’st thou, Silvius?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="SIL.">
  <li data-n="80">Sweet Phebe, pity me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="PHE.">
  <li data-n="81">Why, I am sorry for thee, gentle Silvius.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="SIL.">
  <li data-n="82">Where ever sorrow is, relief would be.</li>
  <li data-n="83">If you do sorrow at my grief in love,</li>
  <li data-n="84">By giving love, your sorrow and my grief</li>
  <li data-n="85">Were both extermin’d.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="PHE.">
  <li data-n="86">Thou hast my love; is not that neighborly?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="SIL.">
  <li data-n="87">I would have you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="PHE.">
  <li data-n="87" data-o="4">Why, that were covetousness.</li>
  <li data-n="88">Silvius, the time was that I hated thee;</li>
  <li data-n="89">And yet it is not that I bear thee love,</li>
  <li data-n="90">But since that thou canst talk of love so well,</li>
  <li data-n="91">Thy company, which erst was irksome to me,</li>
  <li data-n="92">I will endure; and I’ll employ thee too.</li>
  <li data-n="93">But do not look for further recompense</li>
  <li data-n="94">Than thine own gladness that thou art employ’d.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="SIL.">
  <li data-n="95">So holy and so perfect is my love,</li>
  <li data-n="96">And I in such a poverty of grace,</li>
  <li data-n="97">That I shall think it a most plenteous crop</li>
  <li data-n="98">To glean the broken ears after the man</li>
  <li data-n="99">That the main harvest reaps. Loose now and then</li>
  <li data-n="100">A scatt’red smile, and that I’ll live upon.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="PHE.">
  <li data-n="101">Know’st thou the youth that spoke to me yerwhile?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="SIL.">
  <li data-n="102">Not very well, but I have met him oft,</li>
  <li data-n="103">And he hath bought the cottage and the bounds</li>
  <li data-n="104">That the old carlot once was master of.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="PHE.">
  <li data-n="105">Think not I love him, though I ask for him;</li>
  <li data-n="106">’Tis but a peevish boy—yet he talks well—</li>
  <li data-n="107">But what care I for words? Yet words do well</li>
  <li data-n="108">When he that speaks them pleases those that hear.</li>
  <li data-n="109">It is a pretty youth—not very pretty—</li>
  <li data-n="110">But sure he’s proud—and yet his pride becomes him.</li>
  <li data-n="111">He’ll make a proper man. The best thing in him</li>
  <li data-n="112">Is his complexion; and faster than his tongue</li>
  <li data-n="113">Did make offense, his eye did heal it up.</li>
  <li data-n="114">He is not very tall—yet for his years he’s tall;</li>
  <li data-n="115">His leg is but so so—and yet ’tis well;</li>
  <li data-n="116">There was a pretty redness in his lip,</li>
  <li data-n="117">A little riper and more lusty red</li>
  <li data-n="118">Than that mix’d in his cheek; ’twas just the difference</li>
  <li data-n="119">Betwixt the constant red and mingled damask.</li>
  <li data-n="120">There be some women, Silvius, had they mark’d him</li>
  <li data-n="121">In parcels as I did, would have gone near</li>
  <li data-n="122">To fall in love with him; but for my part</li>
  <li data-n="123">I love him not, nor hate him not; and yet</li>
  <li data-n="124">Have more cause to hate him than to love him,</li>
  <li data-n="125">For what had he to do to chide at me?</li>
  <li data-n="126">He said mine eyes were black and my hair black,</li>
  <li data-n="127">And, now I am rememb’red, scorn’d at me.</li>
  <li data-n="128">I marvel why I answer’d not again.</li>
  <li data-n="129">But that’s all one; omittance is no quittance.</li>
  <li data-n="130">I’ll write to him a very taunting letter,</li>
  <li data-n="131">And thou shalt bear it; wilt thou, Silvius?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="SIL.">
  <li data-n="132">Phebe, with all my heart.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="PHE.">
  <li data-n="132" data-o="5">I’ll write it straight;</li>
  <li data-n="133">The matter’s in my head and in my heart.</li>
  <li data-n="134">I will be bitter with him and passing short.</li>
  <li data-n="135">Go with me, Silvius.</li>

<h3>Scene 1</h3>

<h4 class="direction-location">The Forest of Arden.</h4>

<div class="direction-location">
	Enter Rosalind and Celia and Jaques.
	
		ROS.
		CEL.
		JAQ.
	
</div>

<ol data-s="JAQ.">
  <li data-n="1">I prithee, pretty youth, let me be better acquainted with thee.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ROS.">
  <li data-n="2">They say you are a melancholy fellow.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="JAQ.">
  <li data-n="3">I am so; I do love it better than laughing.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ROS.">
  <li data-n="4">Those that are in extremity of either are abominable fellows, and betray themselves to every modern censure worse than drunkards.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="JAQ.">
  <li data-n="5">Why, ’tis good to be sad and say nothing.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ROS.">
  <li data-n="6">Why then ’tis good to be a post.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="JAQ.">
  <li data-n="7">I have neither the scholar’s melancholy, which is emulation; nor the musician’s, which is fantastical; nor the courtier’s, which is proud; nor the soldier’s, which is ambitious; nor the lawyer’s, which is politic; nor the lady’s, which is nice; nor the lover’s, which is all these: but it is a melancholy of mine own, compounded of many simples, extracted from many objects, and indeed the sundry contemplation of my travels, in which my often rumination wraps me in a most humorous sadness.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ROS.">
  <li data-n="8">A traveler! By my faith, you have great reason to be sad. I fear you have sold your own lands to see other men’s; then to have seen much, and to have nothing, is to have rich eyes and poor hands.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="JAQ.">
  <li data-n="9">Yes, I have gain’d my experience.</li>
</ol>

<div class="direction-location">
	Enter Orlando.
	
		ORL.
	
</div>

<ol data-s="ROS.">
  <li data-n="10">And your experience makes you sad. I had rather have a fool to make me merry than experience to make me sad—and to travel for it too!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ORL.">
  <li data-n="11">Good day and happiness, dear Rosalind!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="JAQ.">
  <li data-n="12">Nay then God buy you, and you talk in blank verse.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ROS.">
  <li data-n="13">Farewell, <span class="foreign" title="French">Monsieur</span> Traveler: look you lisp and wear strange suits; disable all the benefits of your own country; be out of love with your nativity, and almost chide God for making you that countenance you are; or I will scarce think you have swam in a gundello.</li>
  <li class="direction-location">
	Exit Jaques.
	
		JAQ.
	
</li>
  <li data-n="14">Why, how now, Orlando, where have you been all this while? You a lover! And you serve me such another trick, never come in my sight more.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ORL.">
  <li data-n="15">My fair Rosalind, I come within an hour of my promise.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ROS.">
  <li data-n="16">Break an hour’s promise in love! He that will divide a minute into a thousand parts, and break but a part of the thousand part of a minute in the affairs of love, it may be said of him that Cupid hath clapp’d him o’ th’ shoulder, but I’ll warrant him heart-whole.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ORL.">
  <li data-n="17">Pardon me, dear Rosalind.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ROS.">
  <li data-n="18">Nay, and you be so tardy, come no more in my sight. I had as lief be woo’d of a snail.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ORL.">
  <li data-n="19">Of a snail?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ROS.">
  <li data-n="20">Ay, of a snail; for though he comes slowly, he carries his house on his head; a better jointure I think than you make a woman. Besides, he brings his destiny with him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ORL.">
  <li data-n="21">What’s that?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ROS.">
  <li data-n="22">Why, horns! Which such as you are fain to be beholding to your wives for. But he comes arm’d in his fortune, and prevents the slander of his wife.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ORL.">
  <li data-n="23">Virtue is no horn-maker; and my Rosalind is virtuous.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ROS.">
  <li data-n="24">And I am your Rosalind.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="CEL.">
  <li data-n="25">It pleases him to call you so; but he hath a Rosalind of a better leer than you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ROS.">
  <li data-n="26">Come, woo me, woo me; for now I am in a holiday humor, and like enough to consent. What would you say to me now, and I were your very very Rosalind?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ORL.">
  <li data-n="27">I would kiss before I spoke.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ROS.">
  <li data-n="28">Nay, you were better speak first, and when you were gravell’d for lack of matter, you might take occasion to kiss. Very good orators when they are out, they will spit, and for lovers lacking (God warn us!) matter, the cleanliest shift is to kiss.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ORL.">
  <li data-n="29">How if the kiss be denied?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ROS.">
  <li data-n="30">Then she puts you to entreaty, and there begins new matter.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ORL.">
  <li data-n="31">Who could be out, being before his belov’d mistress?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ROS.">
  <li data-n="32">Marry, that should you if I were your mistress, or I should think my honesty ranker than my wit.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ORL.">
  <li data-n="33">What, of my suit?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ROS.">
  <li data-n="34">Not out of your apparel, and yet out of your suit. Am not I your Rosalind?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ORL.">
  <li data-n="35">I take some joy to say you are, because I would be talking of her.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ROS.">
  <li data-n="36">Well, in her person, I say I will not have you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ORL.">
  <li data-n="37">Then in mine own person, I die.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ROS.">
  <li data-n="38">No, faith, die by attorney. The poor world is almost six thousand years old, and in all this time there was not any man died in his own person, <span class="foreign" title="Latin">videlicet</span>, in a love-cause. Troilus had his brains dash’d out with a Grecian club, yet he did what he could to die before, and he is one of the patterns of love. Leander, he would have liv’d many a fair year though Hero had turn’d nun, if it had not been for a hot midsummer night; for, good youth, he went but forth to wash him in the Hellespont, and being taken with the cramp was drown’d; and the foolish chroniclers of that age found it was—Hero of Sestos. But these are all lies: men have died from time to time, and worms have eaten them, but not for love.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ORL.">
  <li data-n="39">I would not have my right Rosalind of this mind, for I protest her frown might kill me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ROS.">
  <li data-n="40">By this hand, it will not kill a fly. But come, now I will be your Rosalind in a more coming-on disposition; and ask me what you will, I will grant it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ORL.">
  <li data-n="41">Then love me, Rosalind.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ROS.">
  <li data-n="42">Yes, faith, will I, Fridays and Saturdays and all.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ORL.">
  <li data-n="43">And wilt thou have me?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ROS.">
  <li data-n="44">Ay, and twenty such.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ORL.">
  <li data-n="45">What sayest thou?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ROS.">
  <li data-n="46">Are you not good?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ORL.">
  <li data-n="47">I hope so.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ROS.">
  <li data-n="48">Why then, can one desire too much of a good thing? Come, sister, you shall be the priest, and marry us. Give me your hand, Orlando. What do you say, sister?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ORL.">
  <li data-n="49">Pray thee marry us.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="CEL.">
  <li data-n="50">I cannot say the words.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ROS.">
  <li data-n="51">You must begin, “Will you, Orlando”—</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="CEL.">
  <li data-n="52">Go to! Will you, Orlando, have to wife this Rosalind?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ORL.">
  <li data-n="53">I will.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ROS.">
  <li data-n="54">Ay, but when?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ORL.">
  <li data-n="55">Why, now, as fast as she can marry us.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ROS.">
  <li data-n="56">Then you must say, “I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.”</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ORL.">
  <li data-n="57">I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ROS.">
  <li data-n="58">I might ask you for your commission, but I do take thee, Orlando, for my husband. There’s a girl goes before the priest, and certainly a woman’s thought runs before her actions.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ORL.">
  <li data-n="59">So do all thoughts, they are wing’d.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ROS.">
  <li data-n="60">Now tell me how long you would have her after you have possess’d her.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ORL.">
  <li data-n="61">Forever and a day.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ROS.">
  <li data-n="62">Say “a day,” without the “ever.” No, no, Orlando, men are April when they woo, December when they wed; maids are May when they are maids, but the sky changes when they are wives. I will be more jealous of thee than a Barbary cock-pigeon over his hen, more clamorous than a parrot against rain, more new-fangled than an ape, more giddy in my desires than a monkey. I will weep for nothing, like Diana in the fountain, and I will do that when you are dispos’d to be merry. I will laugh like a hyen, and that when thou art inclin’d to sleep.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ORL.">
  <li data-n="63">But will my Rosalind do so?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ROS.">
  <li data-n="64">By my life, she will do as I do.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ORL.">
  <li data-n="65">O, but she is wise.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ROS.">
  <li data-n="66">Or else she could not have the wit to do this; the wiser, the waywarder. Make the doors upon a woman’s wit, and it will out at the casement; shut that, and ’twill out at the key-hole; stop that, ’twill fly with the smoke out at the chimney.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ORL.">
  <li data-n="67">A man that had a wife with such a wit, he might say, “Wit, whither wilt?”</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ROS.">
  <li data-n="68">Nay, you might keep that check for it, till you met your wive’s wit going to your neighbor’s bed.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ORL.">
  <li data-n="69">And what wit could wit have to excuse that?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ROS.">
  <li data-n="70">Marry, to say she came to seek you there. You shall never take her without her answer, unless you take her without her tongue. O, that woman that cannot make her fault her husband’s occasion, let her never nurse her child herself, for she will breed it like a fool!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ORL.">
  <li data-n="71">For these two hours, Rosalind, I will leave thee.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ROS.">
  <li data-n="72">Alas, dear love, I cannot lack thee two hours!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ORL.">
  <li data-n="73">I must attend the Duke at dinner. By two a’ clock I will be with thee again.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ROS.">
  <li data-n="74">Ay, go your ways, go your ways; I knew what you would prove; my friends told me as much, and I thought no less. That flattering tongue of yours won me. ’Tis but one cast away, and so come death! Two a’ clock is your hour?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ORL.">
  <li data-n="75">Ay, sweet Rosalind.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ROS.">
  <li data-n="76">By my troth, and in good earnest, and so God mend me, and by all pretty oaths that are not dangerous, if you break one jot of your promise, or come one minute behind your hour, I will think you the most pathetical break-promise, and the most hollow lover, and the most unworthy of her you call Rosalind, that may be chosen out of the gross band of the unfaithful; therefore beware my censure, and keep your promise.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ORL.">
  <li data-n="77">With no less religion than if thou wert indeed my Rosalind; so <span class="foreign" title="French">adieu</span>.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ROS.">
  <li data-n="78">Well, Time is the old justice that examines all such offenders, and let Time try. <span class="foreign" title="French">Adieu</span>.</li>

<ol data-s="ROS.">
  <li data-n="80">O coz, coz, coz, my pretty little coz, that thou didst know how many fathom deep I am in love! But it cannot be sounded; my affection hath an unknown bottom, like the bay of Portugal.</li>
</ol>

  <li data-n="81">Or rather, bottomless—that as fast as you pour affection in, it runs out.</li>

<ol data-s="ROS.">
  <li data-n="12">O, I know where you are. Nay, ’tis true. There was never any thing so sudden but the fight of two rams, and Caesar’s thrasonical brag of “I came, saw, and overcame.” For your brother and my sister no sooner met but they look’d; no sooner look’d but they lov’d; no sooner lov’d but they sigh’d; no sooner sigh’d but they ask’d one another the reason; no sooner knew the reason but they sought the remedy: and in these degrees have they made a pair of stairs to marriage, which they will climb incontinent, or else be incontinent before marriage. They are in the very wrath of love, and they will together. Clubs cannot part them.</li>

  <li data-n="16">I will weary you then no longer with idle talking. Know of me then (for now I speak to some purpose) that I know you are a gentleman of good conceit. I speak not this that you should bear a good opinion of my knowledge, insomuch I say I know you are; neither do I labor for a greater esteem than may in some little measure draw a belief from you, to do yourself good, and not to grace me. Believe then, if you please, that I can do strange things. I have, since I was three year old, convers’d with a magician, most profound in his art, and yet not damnable. If you do love Rosalind so near the heart as your gesture cries it out, when your brother marries Aliena, shall you marry her. I know into what straits of fortune she is driven, and it is not impossible to me, if it appear not inconvenient to you, to set her before your eyes tomorrow, human as she is, and without any danger.</li>

<ol data-s="TOUCH.">
  <li data-n="38">If any man doubt that, let him put me to my purgation. I have trod a measure, I have flatt’red a lady, I have been politic with my friend, smooth with mine enemy, I have undone three tailors, I have had four quarrels, and like to have fought one.</li>

  <li data-n="43">God ’ild you, sir, I desire you of the like. I press in here, sir, amongst the rest of the country copulatives, to swear and to forswear, according as marriage binds and blood breaks. A poor virgin, sir, an ill-favor’d thing, sir, but mine own; a poor humor of mine, sir, to take that that no man else will. Rich honesty dwells like a miser, sir, in a poor house, as your pearl in your foul oyster.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="DUKE S.">
  <li data-n="44">By my faith, he is very swift and sententious.</li>

</ol>

<ol data-s="JAQ.">
  <li data-n="46">But for the seventh cause—how did you find the quarrel on the seventh cause?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="TOUCH.">
  <li data-n="47">Upon a lie seven times remov’d (bear your body more seeming, Audrey), as thus, sir. I did dislike the cut of a certain courtier’s beard. He sent me word, if I said his beard was not cut well, he was in the mind it was: this is call’d the Retort Courteous. If I sent him word again, it was not well cut, he would send me word he cut it to please himself: this is call’d the Quip Modest. If again, it was not well cut, he disabled my judgment: this is call’d the Reply Churlish. If again, it was not well cut, he would answer I spake not true: this is call’d the Reproof Valiant. If again, it was not well cut, he would say I lie: this is call’d the Countercheck Quarrelsome; and so to Lie Circumstantial and the Lie Direct.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="JAQ.">
  <li data-n="48">And how oft did you say his beard was not well cut?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="TOUCH.">
  <li data-n="49">I durst go no further than the Lie Circumstantial, nor he durst not give me the Lie Direct; and so we measur’d swords and parted.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="JAQ.">
  <li data-n="50">Can you nominate in order now the degrees of the lie?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="TOUCH.">
  <li data-n="51">O sir, we quarrel in print, by the book—as you have books for good manners. I will name you the degrees. The first, the Retort Courteous; the second, the Quip Modest; the third, the Reply Churlish; the fourth, the Reproof Valiant; the fift, the Countercheck Quarrelsome; the sixt, the Lie with Circumstance; the seventh, the Lie Direct. All these you may avoid but the Lie Direct; and you may avoid that too, with an If. I knew when seven justices could not take up a quarrel, but when the parties were met themselves, one of them thought but of an If, as, “If you said so, then I said so”; and they shook hands and swore brothers. Your If is the only peacemaker; much virtue in If.</li>
