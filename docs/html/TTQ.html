<section class="stanza">
  <p data-n="1">As the dial hand tells o’er</p>
  <p data-n="2">The same hours it had before,</p>
  <p data-n="3">Circular account still lending,</p>
  <p data-n="4">So, most mighty Queen we pray,</p>
  <p data-n="5">Like the dial day by day</p>
  <p data-n="6">You may lead the seasons on,</p>
  <p data-n="7">Making new when old are gone,</p>
  <p data-n="8">That the babe which now is young</p>
  <p data-n="9">And hath yet no use of tongue</p>
  <p data-n="10">Many a Shrovetide here may bow</p>
  <p data-n="11">To that empress I do now,</p>
  <p data-n="12">That these children of these lords,</p>
  <p data-n="13">Sitting at your council boards,</p>
  <p data-n="14">May be grave and agèd seen</p>
  <p data-n="15">Of her that was their fathers’ queen.</p>
  <p data-n="16">Once I wish this wish again,</p>
  <p data-n="17">Heaven subscribe it with “Amen”.</p>
