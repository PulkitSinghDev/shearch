<ol data-s="KING.">
  <li data-n="1">So shaken as we are, so wan with care,</li>
  <li data-n="2">Find we a time for frighted peace to pant</li>
  <li data-n="3">And breathe short-winded accents of new broils</li>
  <li data-n="4">To be commenc’d in stronds afar remote.</li>
  <li data-n="5">No more the thirsty entrance of this soil</li>
  <li data-n="6">Shall daub her lips with her own children’s blood,</li>
  <li data-n="7">No more shall trenching war channel her fields,</li>
  <li data-n="8">Nor bruise her flow’rets with the armed hoofs</li>
  <li data-n="9">Of hostile paces. Those opposed eyes,</li>
  <li data-n="10">Which, like the meteors of a troubled heaven,</li>
  <li data-n="11">All of one nature, of one substance bred,</li>
  <li data-n="12">Did lately meet in the intestine shock</li>
  <li data-n="13">And furious close of civil butchery,</li>
  <li data-n="14">Shall now, in mutual well-beseeming ranks,</li>
  <li data-n="15">March all one way and be no more oppos’d</li>
  <li data-n="16">Against acquaintance, kindred, and allies.</li>
  <li data-n="17">The edge of war, like an ill-sheathed knife,</li>
  <li data-n="18">No more shall cut his master. Therefore, friends,</li>
  <li data-n="19">As far as to the sepulchre of Christ—</li>
  <li data-n="20">Whose soldier now, under whose blessed cross</li>
  <li data-n="21">We are impressed and engag’d to fight—</li>
  <li data-n="22">Forthwith a power of English shall we levy,</li>
  <li data-n="23">Whose arms were moulded in their mother’s womb,</li>
  <li data-n="24">To chase these pagans in those holy fields,</li>
  <li data-n="25">Over whose acres walk’d those blessed feet</li>
  <li data-n="26">Which fourteen hundred years ago were nail’d</li>
  <li data-n="27">For our advantage on the bitter cross.</li>
  <li data-n="28">But this our purpose now is twelve month old,</li>
  <li data-n="29">And bootless ’tis to tell you we will go;</li>
  <li data-n="30">Therefore we meet not now. Then let me hear</li>
  <li data-n="31">Of you, my gentle cousin Westmorland,</li>
  <li data-n="32">What yesternight our Council did decree</li>
  <li data-n="33">In forwarding this dear expedience.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="WEST.">
  <li data-n="34">My liege, this haste was hot in question.</li>
  <li data-n="35">And many limits of the charge set down</li>
  <li data-n="36">But yesternight, when all athwart there came</li>
  <li data-n="37">A post from Wales loaden with heavy news,</li>
  <li data-n="38">Whose worst was that the noble Mortimer,</li>
  <li data-n="39">Leading the men of Herfordshire to fight</li>
  <li data-n="40">Against the irregular and wild Glendower,</li>
  <li data-n="41">Was by the rude hands of that Welshman taken,</li>
  <li data-n="42">A thousand of his people butchered,</li>
  <li data-n="43">Upon whose dead corpse’ there was such misuse,</li>
  <li data-n="44">Such beastly shameless transformation,</li>
  <li data-n="45">By those Welshwomen done as may not be</li>
  <li data-n="46">Without much shame retold or spoken of.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="KING.">
  <li data-n="47">It seems then that the tidings of this broil</li>
  <li data-n="48">Brake off our business for the Holy Land.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="WEST.">
  <li data-n="49">This match’d with other did, my gracious lord,</li>
  <li data-n="50">For more uneven and unwelcome news</li>
  <li data-n="51">Came from the north, and thus it did import:</li>
  <li data-n="52">On <date when=" — 09-14" type="holiday" subtype="Christian">Holy-rood day</date>, the gallant Hotspur there,</li>
  <li data-n="53">Young Harry Percy, and brave Archibald,</li>
  <li data-n="54">That ever-valiant and approved Scot,</li>
  <li data-n="55">At Holmedon met,</li>
  <li data-n="56">Where they did spend a sad and bloody hour,</li>
  <li data-n="57">As by discharge of their artillery</li>
  <li data-n="58">And shape of likelihood the news was told;</li>
  <li data-n="59">For he that brought them, in the very heat</li>
  <li data-n="60">And pride of their contention did take horse,</li>
  <li data-n="61">Uncertain of the issue any way.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="KING.">
  <li data-n="62">Here is a dear, a true industrious friend,</li>
  <li data-n="63">Sir Walter Blunt, new lighted from his horse,</li>
  <li data-n="64">Stain’d with the variation of each soil</li>
  <li data-n="65">Betwixt that Holmedon and this seat of ours;</li>
  <li data-n="66">And he hath brought us smooth and welcome news.</li>
  <li data-n="67">The Earl of Douglas is discomfited:</li>
  <li data-n="68">Ten thousand bold Scots, two and twenty knights,</li>
  <li data-n="69">Balk’d in their own blood, did Sir Walter see</li>
  <li data-n="70">On Holmedon’s plains. Of prisoners, Hotspur took</li>
  <li data-n="71">Mordake Earl of Fife and eldest son</li>
  <li data-n="72">To beaten Douglas, and the Earl of Athol,</li>
  <li data-n="73">Of Murray, Angus, and Menteith.</li>
  <li data-n="74">And is not this an honorable spoil?</li>
  <li data-n="75">A gallant prize? Ha, cousin, is it not?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="WEST.">
  <li data-n="76">In faith,</li>
  <li data-n="77">It is a conquest for a prince to boast of.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="KING.">
  <li data-n="78">Yea, there thou mak’st me sad, and mak’st me sin</li>
  <li data-n="79">In envy that my Lord Northumberland</li>
  <li data-n="80">Should be the father to so blest a son—</li>
  <li data-n="81"> A son who is the theme of honor’s tongue,</li>
  <li data-n="82">Amongst a grove the very straightest plant,</li>
  <li data-n="83">Who is sweet Fortune’s minion and her pride,</li>
  <li data-n="84">Whilst I, by looking on the praise of him,</li>
  <li data-n="85">See riot and dishonor stain the brow</li>
  <li data-n="86">Of my young Harry. O that it could be prov’d</li>
  <li data-n="87">That some night-tripping fairy had exchang’d</li>
  <li data-n="88">In cradle-clothes our children where they lay,</li>
  <li data-n="89">And call’d mine Percy, his Plantagenet!</li>
  <li data-n="90">Then would I have his Harry and he mine.</li>
  <li data-n="91">But let him from my thoughts. What think you, coz,</li>
  <li data-n="92">Of this young Percy’s pride? The prisoners</li>
  <li data-n="93">Which he in this adventure hath surpris’d</li>
  <li data-n="94">To his own use he keeps, and sends me word</li>
  <li data-n="95">I shall have none but Mordake Earl of Fife.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="WEST.">
  <li data-n="96">This is his uncle’s teaching; this is Worcester,</li>
  <li data-n="97">Malevolent to you in all aspects,</li>
  <li data-n="98">Which makes him prune himself, and bristle up</li>
  <li data-n="99">The crest of youth against your dignity.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="KING.">
  <li data-n="100">But I have sent for him to answer this;</li>
  <li data-n="101">And for this cause a while we must neglect</li>
  <li data-n="102">Our holy purpose to Jerusalem.</li>
  <li data-n="103">Cousin, on Wednesday next our Council we</li>
  <li data-n="104">Will hold at Windsor, so inform the lords.</li>
  <li data-n="105">But come yourself with speed to us again,</li>
  <li data-n="106">For more is to be said and to be done</li>
  <li data-n="107">Than out of anger can be uttered.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="WEST.">
  <li data-n="108">I will, my liege.</li>

<h3>Scene 2</h3>

<h4 class="direction-location">London. An apartment of the Prince’s.</h4>

<div class="direction-location">
	Enter Prince of Wales and Sir John Falstaff.
	
		PRINCE.
		FAL.
	
</div>

<ol data-s="FAL.">
  <li data-n="1">Now, Hal, what time of day is it, lad?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="PRINCE.">
  <li data-n="2">Thou art so fat-witted with drinking of old sack, and unbuttoning thee after supper, and sleeping upon benches after noon, that thou hast forgotten to demand that truly which thou wouldest truly know. What a devil hast thou to do with the time of the day? Unless hours were cups of sack, and minutes capons, and clocks the tongues of bawds, and dials the signs of leaping-houses, and the blessed sun himself a fair hot wench in flame-color’d taffeta; I see no reason why thou shouldst be so superfluous to demand the time of the day.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="FAL.">
  <li data-n="3">Indeed you come near me now, Hal, for we that take purses go by the moon and the seven stars, and not by Phoebus, he, “that wand’ring knight so fair.” And I prithee, sweet wag, when thou art a king, as, God save thy Grace—Majesty I should say, for grace thou wilt have none—</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="PRINCE.">
  <li data-n="4">What, none?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="FAL.">
  <li data-n="5">No, by my troth, not so much as will serve to be prologue to an egg and butter.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="PRINCE.">
  <li data-n="6">Well, how then? Come, roundly, roundly.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="FAL.">
  <li data-n="7">Marry, then, sweet wag, when thou art king, let not us that are squires of the night’s body be call’d thieves of the day’s beauty. Let us be Diana’s foresters, gentlemen of the shade, minions of the moon, and let men say we be men of good government, being govern’d, as the sea is, by our noble and chaste mistress the moon, under whose countenance we steal.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="PRINCE.">
  <li data-n="8">Thou sayest well, and it holds well too, for the fortune of us that are the moon’s men doth ebb and flow like the sea, being govern’d, as the sea is, by the moon. As, for proof, now: a purse of gold most resolutely snatch’d on Monday night and most dissolutely spent on Tuesday morning; got with swearing “Lay by,” and spent with crying “Bring in”; now in as low an ebb as the foot of the ladder, and by and by in as high a flow as the ridge of the gallows.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="FAL.">
  <li data-n="9">By the Lord, thou say’st true, lad. And is not my hostess of the tavern a most sweet wench?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="PRINCE.">
  <li data-n="10">As the honey of Hybla, my old lad of the castle. And is not a buff jerkin a most sweet robe of durance?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="FAL.">
  <li data-n="11">How now, how now, mad wag? What, in thy quips and thy quiddities? What a plague have I to do with a buff jerkin?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="PRINCE.">
  <li data-n="12">Why, what a pox have I to do with my hostess of the tavern?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="FAL.">
  <li data-n="13">Well, thou hast call’d her to a reckoning many a time and oft.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="PRINCE.">
  <li data-n="14">Did I ever call for thee to pay thy part?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="FAL.">
  <li data-n="15">No, I’ll give thee thy due, thou hast paid all there.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="PRINCE.">
  <li data-n="16">Yea, and elsewhere, so far as my coin would stretch, and where it would not, I have us’d my credit.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="FAL.">
  <li data-n="17">Yea, and so us’d it that, were it not here apparent that thou art heir apparent—But I prithee, sweet wag, shall there be gallows standing in England when thou art king? And resolution thus fubb’d as it is with the rusty curb of old father antic the law? Do not thou, when thou art king, hang a thief.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="PRINCE.">
  <li data-n="18">No, thou shalt.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="FAL.">
  <li data-n="19">Shall I? O rare! By the Lord, I’ll be a brave judge.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="PRINCE.">
  <li data-n="20">Thou judgest false already. I mean thou shalt have the hanging of the thieves, and so become a rare hangman.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="FAL.">
  <li data-n="21">Well, Hal, well, and in some sort it jumps with my humor as well as waiting in the court, I can tell you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="PRINCE.">
  <li data-n="22">For obtaining of suits?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="FAL.">
  <li data-n="23">Yea, for obtaining of suits, whereof the hangman hath no lean wardrobe. ’Sblood, I am as melancholy as a gib cat or a lugg’d bear.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="PRINCE.">
  <li data-n="24">Or an old lion, or a lover’s lute.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="FAL.">
  <li data-n="25">Yea, or the drone of a Lincolnshire bagpipe.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="PRINCE.">
  <li data-n="26">What sayest thou to a hare, or the melancholy of Moor-ditch?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="FAL.">
  <li data-n="27">Thou hast the most unsavory similes and art indeed the most comparative, rascalliest, sweet young prince. But, Hal, I prithee trouble me no more with vanity; I would to God thou and I knew where a commodity of good names were to be bought. An old lord of the Council rated me the other day in the street about you, sir, but I mark’d him not, and yet he talk’d very wisely, but I regarded him not, and yet he talk’d wisely, and in the street too.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="PRINCE.">
  <li data-n="28">Thou didst well, for wisdom cries out in the streets, and no man regards it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="FAL.">
  <li data-n="29">O, thou hast damnable iteration, and art indeed able to corrupt a saint. Thou hast done much harm upon me, Hal, God forgive thee for it! Before I knew thee, Hal, I knew nothing, and now am I, if a man should speak truly, little better than one of the wicked. I must give over this life, and I will give it over. By the Lord, and I do not, I am a villain, I’ll be damn’d for never a king’s son in Christendom.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="PRINCE.">
  <li data-n="30">Where shall we take a purse tomorrow, Jack?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="FAL.">
  <li data-n="31">’Zounds, where thou wilt, lad, I’ll make one, an’ I do not, call me villain and baffle me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="PRINCE.">
  <li data-n="32">I see a good amendment of life in thee, from praying to purse-taking.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="FAL.">
  <li data-n="33">Why, Hal, ’tis my vocation, Hal, ’tis no sin for a man to labor in his vocation.</li>
  <li class="direction-location">
	Enter Poins.
	
		POINS.
	
</li>
  <li data-n="34">Poins! Now shall we know if Gadshill have set a match. O, if men were to be sav’d by merit, what hole in hell were hot enough for him? This is the most omnipotent villain that ever cried “Stand!” to a true man.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="PRINCE.">
  <li data-n="35">Good morrow, Ned.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="POINS.">
  <li data-n="36">Good morrow, sweet Hal. What says <span class="foreign" title="French">Monsieur</span> Remorse? What says Sir John Sack and Sugar? Jack, how agrees the devil and thee about thy soul that thou soldest him on Good Friday last, for a cup of Madeira and a cold capon’s leg?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="PRINCE.">
  <li data-n="37">Sir John stands to his word, the devil shall have his bargain, for he was never yet a breaker of proverbs. He will give the devil his due.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="POINS.">
  <li data-n="38">Then art thou damn’d for keeping thy word with the devil.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="PRINCE.">
  <li data-n="39">Else he had been damn’d for cozening the devil.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="POINS.">
  <li data-n="40">But, my lads, my lads, tomorrow morning by four a’ clock early, at Gadshill, there are pilgrims going to Canterbury with rich offerings, and traders riding to London with fat purses. I have vizards for you all; you have horses for yourselves. Gadshill lies tonight in Rochester. I have bespoke supper tomorrow night in Eastcheap. We may do it as secure as sleep. If you will go, I will stuff your purses full of crowns; if you will not, tarry at home and be hang’d.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="FAL.">
  <li data-n="41">Hear ye, Yedward, if I tarry at home and go not, I’ll hang you for going.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="POINS.">
  <li data-n="42">You will, chops?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="FAL.">
  <li data-n="43">Hal, wilt thou make one?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="PRINCE.">
  <li data-n="44">Who, I rob? I a thief? Not I, by my faith.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="FAL.">
  <li data-n="45">There’s neither honesty, manhood, nor good fellowship in thee, nor thou cam’st not of the blood royal, if thou darest not stand for ten shillings.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="PRINCE.">
  <li data-n="46">Well then, once in my days I’ll be a madcap.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="FAL.">
  <li data-n="47">Why, that’s well said.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="PRINCE.">
  <li data-n="48">Well, come what will, I’ll tarry at home.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="FAL.">
  <li data-n="49">By the Lord, I’ll be a traitor then, when thou art king.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="PRINCE.">
  <li data-n="50">I care not.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="POINS.">
  <li data-n="51">Sir John, I prithee leave the Prince and me alone, I will lay him down such reasons for this adventure that he shall go.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="FAL.">
  <li data-n="52">Well, God give thee the spirit of persuasion and him the ears of profiting, that what thou speakest may move and what he hears may be believ’d, that the true prince may (for recreation sake) prove a false thief, for the poor abuses of the time want countenance. Farewell, you shall find me in Eastcheap.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="PRINCE.">
  <li data-n="53">Farewell, the latter spring! Farewell, All-hallown summer!</li>

</div>

<ol data-s="POINS.">
  <li data-n="54">Now, my good sweet honey lord, ride with us tomorrow. I have a jest to execute that I cannot manage alone. Falstaff, Bardolph, Peto, and Gadshill shall rob those men that we have already waylaid; yourself and I will not be there; and when they have the booty, if you and I do not rob them, cut this head off from my shoulders.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="PRINCE.">
  <li data-n="55">How shall we part with them in setting forth?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="POINS.">
  <li data-n="56">Why, we will set forth before or after them and appoint them a place of meeting, wherein it is at our pleasure to fail; and then will they adventure upon the exploit themselves, which they shall have no sooner achiev’d but we’ll set upon them.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="PRINCE.">
  <li data-n="57">Yea, but ’tis like that they will know us by our horses, by our habits, and by every other appointment to be ourselves.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="POINS.">
  <li data-n="58">Tut, our horses they shall not see—I’ll tie them in the wood; our vizards we will change after we leave them; and, sirrah, I have cases of buckram for the nonce, to immask our noted outward garments.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="PRINCE.">
  <li data-n="59">Yea, but I doubt they will be too hard for us.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="POINS.">
  <li data-n="60">Well, for two of them, I know them to be as true-bred cowards as ever turn’d back; and for the third, if he fight longer than he sees reason, I’ll forswear arms. The virtue of this jest will be the incomprehensible lies that this same fat rogue will tell us when we meet at supper, how thirty at least he fought with, what wards, what blows, what extremities he endur’d, and in the reproof of this lives the jest.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="PRINCE.">
  <li data-n="61">Well, I’ll go with thee. Provide us all things necessary, and meet me tomorrow night in Eastcheap, there I’ll sup. Farewell.</li>

  <li data-n="63">I know you all, and will a while uphold</li>
  <li data-n="64">The unyok’d humor of your idleness,</li>
  <li data-n="65">Yet herein will I imitate the sun,</li>
  <li data-n="66">Who doth permit the base contagious clouds</li>
  <li data-n="67">To smother up his beauty from the world,</li>
  <li data-n="68">That when he please again to be himself,</li>
  <li data-n="69">Being wanted, he may be more wond’red at</li>
  <li data-n="70">By breaking through the foul and ugly mists</li>
  <li data-n="71">Of vapors that did seem to strangle him.</li>
  <li data-n="72">If all the year were playing holidays,</li>
  <li data-n="73">To sport would be as tedious as to work;</li>
  <li data-n="74">But when they seldom come, they wish’d for come,</li>
  <li data-n="75">And nothing pleaseth but rare accidents.</li>
  <li data-n="76">So when this loose behavior I throw off</li>
  <li data-n="77">And pay the debt I never promised,</li>
  <li data-n="78">By how much better than my word I am,</li>
  <li data-n="79">By so much shall I falsify men’s hopes,</li>
  <li data-n="80">And like bright metal on a sullen ground,</li>
  <li data-n="81">My reformation, glitt’ring o’er my fault,</li>
  <li data-n="82">Shall show more goodly and attract more eyes</li>
  <li data-n="83">Than that which hath no foil to set it off.</li>

  <li data-n="22">You were about to speak.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="NORTH.">
  <li data-n="22" data-o="5">Yea, my good lord.</li>
  <li data-n="23">Those prisoners in your Highness’ name demanded,</li>
  <li data-n="24">Which Harry Percy here at Holmedon took,</li>
  <li data-n="25">Were, as he says, not with such strength denied</li>
  <li data-n="26">As is delivered to your Majesty.</li>
  <li data-n="27">Either envy, therefore, or misprision</li>
  <li data-n="28">Is guilty of this fault, and not my son.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="HOT.">
  <li data-n="29">My liege, I did deny no prisoners,</li>
  <li data-n="30">But I remember, when the fight was done,</li>
  <li data-n="31">When I was dry with rage and extreme toil,</li>
  <li data-n="32">Breathless and faint, leaning upon my sword,</li>
  <li data-n="33">Came there a certain lord, neat, and trimly dress’d,</li>
  <li data-n="34">Fresh as a bridegroom, and his chin new reap’d</li>
  <li data-n="35">Show’d like a stubble-land at harvest-home.</li>
  <li data-n="36">He was perfumed like a milliner,</li>
  <li data-n="37">And ’twixt his finger and his thumb he held</li>
  <li data-n="38">A pouncet-box, which ever and anon</li>
  <li data-n="39">He gave his nose and took’t away again,</li>
  <li data-n="40">Who therewith angry, when it next came there,</li>
  <li data-n="41">Took it in snuff—and still he smil’d and talk’d:</li>
  <li data-n="42">And as the soldiers bore dead bodies by,</li>
  <li data-n="43">He call’d them untaught knaves, unmannerly,</li>
  <li data-n="44">To bring a slovenly unhandsome corse</li>
  <li data-n="45">Betwixt the wind and his nobility.</li>
  <li data-n="46">With many holiday and lady terms</li>
  <li data-n="47">He questioned me, amongst the rest demanded</li>
  <li data-n="48">My prisoners in your Majesty’s behalf.</li>
  <li data-n="49">I then, all smarting with my wounds being cold,</li>
  <li data-n="50">To be so pest’red with a popingay,</li>
  <li data-n="51">Out of my grief and my impatience</li>
  <li data-n="52">Answer’d neglectingly, I know not what—</li>
  <li data-n="53">He should, or he should not—for he made me mad</li>
  <li data-n="54">To see him shine so brisk and smell so sweet,</li>
  <li data-n="55">And talk so like a waiting-gentlewoman</li>
  <li data-n="56">Of guns, and drums, and wounds, God save the mark!</li>
  <li data-n="57">And telling me the sovereignest thing on earth</li>
  <li data-n="58">Was parmaciti for an inward bruise,</li>
  <li data-n="59">And that it was great pity, so it was,</li>
  <li data-n="60">This villainous saltpeter should be digg’d</li>
  <li data-n="61">Out of the bowels of the harmless earth,</li>
  <li data-n="62">Which many a good tall fellow had destroyed</li>
  <li data-n="63">So cowardly, and but for these vile guns</li>
  <li data-n="64">He would himself have been a soldier.</li>
  <li data-n="65">This bald unjointed chat of his, my lord,</li>
  <li data-n="66">I answered indirectly, as I said,</li>
  <li data-n="67">And I beseech you, let not his report</li>
  <li data-n="68">Come current for an accusation</li>
  <li data-n="69">Betwixt my love and your high Majesty.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="BLUNT.">
  <li data-n="70">The circumstance considered, good my lord,</li>
  <li data-n="71">What e’er Lord Harry Percy then had said</li>
  <li data-n="72">To such a person, and in such a place,</li>
  <li data-n="73">At such a time, with all the rest retold,</li>
  <li data-n="74">May reasonably die, and never rise</li>
  <li data-n="75">To do him wrong, or any way impeach</li>
  <li data-n="76">What then he said, so he unsay it now.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="KING.">
  <li data-n="77">Why, yet he doth deny his prisoners,</li>
  <li data-n="78">But with proviso and exception,</li>
  <li data-n="79">That we at our own charge shall ransom straight</li>
  <li data-n="80">His brother-in-law, the foolish Mortimer,</li>
  <li data-n="81">Who, on my soul, hath willfully betray’d</li>
  <li data-n="82">The lives of those that he did lead to fight</li>
  <li data-n="83">Against that great magician, damn’d Glendower,</li>
  <li data-n="84">Whose daughter, as we hear, that Earl of March</li>
  <li data-n="85">Hath lately married. Shall our coffers then</li>
  <li data-n="86">Be emptied to redeem a traitor home?</li>
  <li data-n="87">Shall we buy treason? And indent with fears,</li>
  <li data-n="88">When they have lost and forfeited themselves?</li>
  <li data-n="89">No, on the barren mountains let him starve;</li>
  <li data-n="90">For I shall never hold that man my friend</li>
  <li data-n="91">Whose tongue shall ask me for one penny cost</li>
  <li data-n="92">To ransom home revolted Mortimer.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="HOT.">
  <li data-n="93">Revolted Mortimer!</li>
  <li data-n="94">He never did fall off, my sovereign liege,</li>
  <li data-n="95">But by the chance of war; to prove that true</li>
  <li data-n="96">Needs no more but one tongue for all those wounds,</li>
  <li data-n="97">Those mouthed wounds, which valiantly he took,</li>
  <li data-n="98">When on the gentle Severn’s sedgy bank,</li>
  <li data-n="99">In single opposition hand to hand,</li>
  <li data-n="100">He did confound the best part of an hour</li>
  <li data-n="101">In changing hardiment with great Glendower.</li>
  <li data-n="102">Three times they breath’d and three times did they drink,</li>
  <li data-n="103">Upon agreement, of swift Severn’s flood,</li>
  <li data-n="104">Who then affrighted with their bloody looks,</li>
  <li data-n="105">Ran fearfully among the trembling reeds,</li>
  <li data-n="106">And hid his crisp head in the hollow bank,</li>
  <li data-n="107">Blood-stained with these valiant combatants.</li>
  <li data-n="108">Never did base and rotten policy</li>
  <li data-n="109">Color her working with such deadly wounds,</li>
  <li data-n="110">Nor never could the noble Mortimer</li>
  <li data-n="111">Receive so many, and all willingly.</li>
  <li data-n="112">Then let not him be slandered with revolt.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="KING.">
  <li data-n="113">Thou dost belie him, Percy, thou dost belie him;</li>
  <li data-n="114">He never did encounter with Glendower.</li>
  <li data-n="115">I tell thee,</li>
  <li data-n="116">He durst as well have met the devil alone</li>
  <li data-n="117">As Owen Glendower for an enemy.</li>
  <li data-n="118">Art thou not asham’d? But, sirrah, henceforth</li>
  <li data-n="119">Let me not hear you speak of Mortimer.</li>

</ol>

<ol data-s="CHAM.">
  <li data-n="23">Good morrow, Master Gadshill. It holds current that I told you yesternight: there’s a franklin in the Wild of Kent hath brought three hundred marks with him in gold. I heard him tell it to one of his company last night at supper, a kind of auditor, one that hath abundance of charge too—God knows what. They are up already, and call for eggs and butter. They will away presently.</li>

  <li data-n="26">What talkest thou to me of the hangman? If I hang, I’ll make a fat pair of gallows; for if I hang, old Sir John hangs with me, and thou knowest he is no starveling. Tut, there are other Troyans that thou dream’st not of, the which for sport sake are content to do the profession some grace, that would (if matters should be look’d into) for their own credit sake make all whole. I am join’d with no foot land-rakers, no long-staff sixpenny strikers, none of these mad mustachio purple-hu’d malt-worms, but with nobility and tranquility, burgomasters and great oney’rs, such as can hold in, such as will strike sooner than speak, and speak sooner than drink, and drink sooner than pray; and yet, ’zounds, I lie, for they pray continually to their saint, the commonwealth, or rather, not pray to her, but prey on her, for they ride up and down on her, and make her their boots.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="CHAM.">
  <li data-n="27">What, the commonwealth their boots? Will she hold out water in foul way?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="GADS.">
  <li data-n="28">She will, she will, justice hath liquor’d her. We steal as in a castle, cock-sure; we have the receipt of fern-seed, we walk invisible.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="CHAM.">
  <li data-n="29">Nay, by my faith, I think you are more beholding to the night than to fern-seed for your walking invisible.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="GADS.">
  <li data-n="30">Give me thy hand. Thou shalt have a share in our purchase, as I am a true man.</li>

<ol data-s="PRINCE.">
  <li data-n="1">Ned, prithee come out of that fat room, and lend me thy hand to laugh a little.</li>
</ol>

  <li data-n="2">Where hast been, Hal?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="PRINCE.">
  <li data-n="3">With three or four loggerheads amongst three or four score hogsheads. I have sounded the very base-string of humility. Sirrah, I am sworn brother to a leash of drawers, and can call them all by their christen names, as Tom, Dick, and Francis. They take it already upon their salvation, that though I be but Prince of Wales, yet I am the king of courtesy, and tell me flatly I am no proud Jack like Falstaff, but a Corinthian, a lad of mettle, a good boy (by the Lord, so they call me!), and when I am King of England I shall command all the good lads in Eastcheap. They call drinking deep, dyeing scarlet, and when you breathe in your watering, they cry “hem!” and bid you play it off. To conclude, I am so good a proficient in one quarter of an hour, that I can drink with any tinker in his own language during my life. I tell thee, Ned, thou hast lost much honor that thou wert not with me in this action. But, sweet Ned—to sweeten which name of Ned, I give thee this pennyworth of sugar, clapp’d even now into my hand by an under-skinker, one that never spake other English in his life than “Eight shillings and sixpence,” and “You are welcome,” with this shrill addition, “Anon, anon, sir! Score a pint of bastard in the Half-moon,” or so. But, Ned, to drive away the time till Falstaff come, I prithee do thou stand in some by-room, while I question my puny drawer to what end he gave me the sugar, and do thou never leave calling “Francis,” that his tale to me may be nothing but “Anon.” Step aside, and I’ll show thee a president.</li>

Harry, I do not only marvel where thou spendest thy time, but also how thou art accompanied; for though the camomile, the more it is trodden on, the faster it grows, yet youth, the more it is wasted, the sooner it wears. That thou art my son I have partly thy mother’s word, partly my own opinion, but chiefly a villainous trick of thine eye, and a foolish hanging of thy nether lip, that doth warrant me. If then thou be son to me, here lies the point: why being son to me, art thou so pointed at? Shall the blessed sun of heaven prove a micher and eat blackberries? A question not to be ask’d. Shall the son of England prove a thief and take purses? A question to be ask’d. There is a thing, Harry, which thou hast often heard of, and it is known to many in our land by the name of pitch. This pitch (as ancient writers do report) doth defile, so doth the company thou keepest; for, Harry, now I do not speak to thee in drink, but in tears; not in pleasure, but in passion; not in words only, but in woes also. And yet there is a virtuous man whom I have often noted in thy company, but I know not his name.</li>

If that man should be lewdly given, he deceiveth me; for, Harry, I see virtue in his looks. If then the tree may be known by the fruit, as the fruit by the tree, then peremptorily I speak it, there is virtue in that Falstaff; him keep with, the rest banish. And tell me now, thou naughty varlet, tell me, where hast thou been this month?</li>

Why dost thou converse with that trunk of humors, that bolting-hutch of beastliness, that swoll’n parcel of dropsies, that huge bombard of sack, that stuff’d cloak-bag of guts, that roasted Manningtree ox with the pudding in his belly, that reverent Vice, that grey Iniquity, that father ruffian, that vanity in years? Wherein is he good, but to taste sack and drink it? Wherein neat and cleanly, but to carve a capon and eat it? Wherein cunning, but in craft? Wherein crafty, but in villainy?

That he is old, the more the pity, his white hairs do witness it, but that he is, saving your reverence, a whoremaster, that I utterly deny. If sack and sugar be a fault, God help the wicked! If to be old and merry be a sin, then many an old host that I know is damn’d. If to be fat be to be hated, then Pharaoh’s lean kine are to be lov’d. No, my good lord, banish Peto, banish Bardolph, banish Poins, but for sweet Jack Falstaff, kind Jack Falstaff, true Jack Falstaff, valiant Jack Falstaff, and therefore more valiant, being as he is old Jack Falstaff, banish not him thy Harry’s company, banish not him thy Harry’s company—banish plump Jack, and banish all the world.</li>

  <li data-n="25">And not in fear of your nativity.</li>
  <li data-n="26">Diseased nature oftentimes breaks forth</li>
  <li data-n="27">In strange eruptions; oft the teeming earth</li>

  <li data-n="37">The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes,</li>
  <li data-n="38">The goats ran from the mountains, and the herds</li>
  <li data-n="39">Were strangely clamorous to the frighted fields.</li>
  <li data-n="40">These signs have mark’d me extraordinary,</li>

  <li data-n="78">The remnant northward lying off from Trent.</li>
  <li data-n="79">And our indentures tripartite are drawn,</li>

  <li data-n="86">My father Glendower is not ready yet,</li>

<ol data-s="GLEND.">
  <li data-n="119">I can speak English, lord, as well as you,</li>

  <li data-n="155">In reckoning up the several devils’ names</li>
  <li data-n="156">That were his lackeys. I cried “hum,” and “well, go to,”</li>

  <li data-n="159">Worse than a smoky house. I had rather live</li>
  <li data-n="160">With cheese and garlic in a windmill, far,</li>

  <li data-n="21">Myself of many I am charg’d withal;</li>
  <li data-n="22">Yet such extenuation let me beg</li>
  <li data-n="23">As in reproof of many tales devis’d,</li>
  <li data-n="24">Which oft the ear of greatness needs must hear</li>
  <li data-n="25">By smiling pick-thanks and base newsmongers,</li>
  <li data-n="26">I may for some things true, wherein my youth</li>
  <li data-n="27">Hath faulty wand’red and irregular,</li>
  <li data-n="28">Find pardon on my true submission.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="KING.">
  <li data-n="29">God pardon thee! Yet let me wonder, Harry,</li>
  <li data-n="30">At thy affections, which do hold a wing</li>
  <li data-n="31">Quite from the flight of all thy ancestors.</li>
  <li data-n="32">Thy place in Council thou hast rudely lost,</li>
  <li data-n="33">Which by thy younger brother is supplied,</li>
  <li data-n="34">And art almost an alien to the hearts</li>
  <li data-n="35">Of all the court and princes of my blood;</li>
  <li data-n="36">The hope and expectation of thy time</li>
  <li data-n="37">Is ruin’d, and the soul of every man</li>
  <li data-n="38">Prophetically do forethink thy fall.</li>
  <li data-n="39">Had I so lavish of my presence been,</li>
  <li data-n="40">So common-hackney’d in the eyes of men,</li>
  <li data-n="41">So stale and cheap to vulgar company,</li>
  <li data-n="42">Opinion, that did help me to the crown,</li>
  <li data-n="43">Had still kept loyal to possession,</li>
  <li data-n="44">And left me in reputeless banishment,</li>
  <li data-n="45">A fellow of no mark nor likelihood.</li>
  <li data-n="46">By being seldom seen, I could not stir</li>
  <li data-n="47">But like a comet I was wond’red at,</li>
  <li data-n="48">That men would tell their children, “This is he”;</li>
  <li data-n="49">Others would say, “Where, which is Bullingbrook?”</li>
  <li data-n="50">And then I stole all courtesy from heaven,</li>
  <li data-n="51">And dress’d myself in such humility</li>
  <li data-n="52">That I did pluck allegiance from men’s hearts,</li>
  <li data-n="53">Loud shouts and salutations from their mouths,</li>
  <li data-n="54">Even in the presence of the crowned King.</li>
  <li data-n="55">Thus did I keep my person fresh and new,</li>
  <li data-n="56">My presence, like a robe pontifical,</li>
  <li data-n="57">Ne’er seen but wond’red at, and so my state,</li>
  <li data-n="58">Seldom but sumptuous, show’d like a feast,</li>
  <li data-n="59">And wan by rareness such solemnity.</li>
  <li data-n="60">The skipping King, he ambled up and down,</li>
  <li data-n="61">With shallow jesters, and rash bavin wits,</li>
  <li data-n="62">Soon kindled and soon burnt, carded his state,</li>
  <li data-n="63">Mingled his royalty with cap’ring fools,</li>
  <li data-n="64">Had his great name profaned with their scorns,</li>
  <li data-n="65">And gave his countenance, against his name,</li>
  <li data-n="66">To laugh at gibing boys, and stand the push</li>
  <li data-n="67">Of every beardless vain comparative,</li>
  <li data-n="68">Grew a companion to the common streets,</li>
  <li data-n="69">Enfeoff’d himself to popularity,</li>
  <li data-n="70">That, being daily swallowed by men’s eyes,</li>
  <li data-n="71">They surfeited with honey and began</li>
  <li data-n="72">To loathe the taste of sweetness, whereof a little</li>
  <li data-n="73">More than a little is by much too much.</li>
  <li data-n="74">So when he had occasion to be seen,</li>
  <li data-n="75">He was but as the cuckoo is in June,</li>
  <li data-n="76">Heard, not regarded; seen, but with such eyes</li>
  <li data-n="77">As, sick and blunted with community,</li>
  <li data-n="78">Afford no extraordinary gaze,</li>
  <li data-n="79">Such as is bent on sunlike majesty</li>
  <li data-n="80">When it shines seldom in admiring eyes;</li>
  <li data-n="81">But rather drows’d and hung their eyelids down,</li>
  <li data-n="82">Slept in his face and rend’red such aspect</li>
  <li data-n="83">As cloudy men use to their adversaries,</li>
  <li data-n="84">Being with his presence glutted, gorg’d, and full.</li>
  <li data-n="85">And in that very line, Harry, standest thou,</li>
  <li data-n="86">For thou hast lost thy princely privilege</li>
  <li data-n="87">With vile participation. Not an eye</li>
  <li data-n="88">But is a-weary of thy common sight,</li>
  <li data-n="89">Save mine, which hath desir’d to see thee more,</li>
  <li data-n="90">Which now doth that I would not have it do,</li>
  <li data-n="91">Make blind itself with foolish tenderness.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="PRINCE.">
  <li data-n="92">I shall hereafter, my thrice-gracious lord,</li>
  <li data-n="93">Be more myself.</li>

<ol data-s="KING.">
  <li data-n="94">For all the world</li>
  <li data-n="95">As thou art to this hour was Richard then</li>
  <li data-n="96">When I from France set foot at Ravenspurgh,</li>
  <li data-n="97">And even as I was then is Percy now.</li>
  <li data-n="98">Now by my sceptre, and my soul to boot,</li>
  <li data-n="99">He hath more worthy interest to the state</li>
  <li data-n="100">Than thou the shadow of succession.</li>
  <li data-n="101">For of no right, nor color like to right,</li>
  <li data-n="102">He doth fill fields with harness in the realm,</li>
  <li data-n="103">Turns head against the lion’s armed jaws,</li>
  <li data-n="104">And being no more in debt to years than thou,</li>
  <li data-n="105">Leads ancient lords and reverend bishops on</li>
  <li data-n="106">To bloody battles and to bruising arms.</li>
  <li data-n="107">What never-dying honor hath he got</li>
  <li data-n="108">Against renowned Douglas! Whose high deeds,</li>
  <li data-n="109">Whose hot incursions and great name in arms,</li>
  <li data-n="110">Holds from all soldiers chief majority</li>
  <li data-n="111">And military title capital</li>
  <li data-n="112">Through all the kingdoms that acknowledge Christ.</li>
  <li data-n="113">Thrice hath this Hotspur, Mars in swathling clothes,</li>
  <li data-n="114">This infant warrior, in his enterprises</li>
  <li data-n="115">Discomfited great Douglas, ta’en him once,</li>
  <li data-n="116">Enlarg’d him and made a friend of him,</li>
  <li data-n="117">To fill the mouth of deep defiance up,</li>
  <li data-n="118">And shake the peace and safety of our throne.</li>
  <li data-n="119">And what say you to this? Percy, Northumberland,</li>
  <li data-n="120">The Archbishop’s grace of York, Douglas, Mortimer,</li>
  <li data-n="121">Capitulate against us, and are up.</li>
  <li data-n="122">But wherefore do I tell these news to thee?</li>
  <li data-n="123">Why, Harry, do I tell thee of my foes,</li>
  <li data-n="124">Which art my nearest and dearest enemy?</li>
  <li data-n="125">Thou that art like enough, through vassal fear,</li>
  <li data-n="126">Base inclination, and the start of spleen,</li>
  <li data-n="127">To fight against me under Percy’s pay,</li>
  <li data-n="128">To dog his heels and curtsy at his frowns,</li>
  <li data-n="129">To show how much thou art degenerate.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="PRINCE.">
  <li data-n="130">Do not think so, you shall not find it so,</li>
  <li data-n="131">And God forgive them that so much have sway’d</li>
  <li data-n="132">Your Majesty’s good thoughts away from me!</li>
  <li data-n="133">I will redeem all this on Percy’s head,</li>
  <li data-n="134">And in the closing of some glorious day</li>

  <li data-n="143">For every honor sitting on his helm,</li>
  <li data-n="144">Would they were multitudes, and on my head</li>
  <li data-n="145">My shames redoubled! For the time will come</li>
  <li data-n="146">That I shall make this northern youth exchange</li>

  <li data-n="148">Percy is but my factor, good my lord,</li>

<h3>Scene 3</h3>

<h4 class="direction-location">Eastcheap. The Boar’s Head Tavern.</h4>

<div class="direction-location">
	Enter Falstaff and Bardolph.
	
		FAL.
		BARD.
	
</div>

<ol data-s="FAL.">
  <li data-n="1">Bardolph, am I not fall’n away vilely since this last action? Do I not bate? Do I not dwindle? Why, my skin hangs about me like an old lady’s loose gown; I am wither’d like an old apple-john. Well, I’ll repent, and that suddenly, while I am in some liking. I shall be out of heart shortly, and then I shall have no strength to repent. And I have not forgotten what the inside of a church is made of, I am a peppercorn, a brewer’s horse. The inside of a church! Company, villainous company, hath been the spoil of me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="BARD.">
  <li data-n="2">Sir John, you are so fretful you cannot live long.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="FAL.">
  <li data-n="3">Why, there is it. Come sing me a bawdy song, make me merry. I was as virtuously given as a gentleman need to be, virtuous enough: swore little, dic’d not above seven times—a week, went to a bawdy-house not above once in a quarter—of an hour, paid money that I borrow’d—three or four times, liv’d well and in good compass, and now I live out of all order, out of all compass.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="BARD.">
  <li data-n="4">Why, you are so fat, Sir John, that you must needs be out of all compass, out of all reasonable compass, Sir John.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="FAL.">
  <li data-n="5">Do thou amend thy face, and I’ll amend my life. Thou art our admiral, thou bearest the lantern in the poop, but ’tis in the nose of thee. Thou art the Knight of the Burning Lamp.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="BARD.">
  <li data-n="6">Why, Sir John, my face does you no harm.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="FAL.">
  <li data-n="7">No, I’ll be sworn, I make as good use of it as many a man doth of a death’s-head or a <span class="foreign" title="Latin">memento mori</span>. I never see thy face but I think upon hell-fire and Dives that liv’d in purple; for there he is in his robes, burning, burning. If thou wert any way given to virtue, I would swear by thy face; my oath should be “By this fire, that’s God’s angel.” But thou art altogether given over, and wert indeed, but for the light in thy face, the son of utter darkness. When thou ran’st up Gadshill in the night to catch my horse, if I did not think thou hadst been an <span class="foreign" title="Latin">ignis fatuus</span> or a ball of wildfire, there’s no purchase in money. O, thou art a perpetual triumph, an everlasting bonfire light! Thou hast sav’d me a thousand marks in links and torches, walking with thee in the night betwixt tavern and tavern; but the sack that thou hast drunk me would have bought me lights as good cheap at the dearest chandler’s in Europe. I have maintain’d that salamander of yours with fire any time this two and thirty years, God reward me for it!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="BARD.">
  <li data-n="8">’Sblood, I would my face were in your belly!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="FAL.">
  <li data-n="9">God-a-mercy, so should I be sure to be heart-burnt.</li>
  <li class="direction-location">
	Enter Hostess.
	
		HOST.	
	
</li>
  <li data-n="10">How now, Dame Partlet the hen? Have you inquir’d yet who pick’d my pocket?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="HOST.">
  <li data-n="11">Why, Sir John, what do you think, Sir John? Do you think I keep thieves in my house? I have search’d, I have inquir’d, so has my husband, man by man, boy by boy, servant by servant. The tithe of a hair was never lost in my house before.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="FAL.">
  <li data-n="12">Ye lie, hostess, Bardolph was shav’d, and lost many a hair, and I’ll be sworn my pocket was pick’d. Go to, you are a woman, go.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="HOST.">
  <li data-n="13">Who, I? No, I defy thee. God’s light, I was never call’d so in mine own house before.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="FAL.">
  <li data-n="14">Go to, I know you well enough.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="HOST.">
  <li data-n="15">No, Sir John, you do not know me, Sir John. I know you, Sir John, you owe me money, Sir John, and now you pick a quarrel to beguile me of it. I bought you a dozen of shirts to your back.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="FAL.">
  <li data-n="16">Dowlas, filthy dowlas. I have given them away to bakers’ wives, they have made bolters of them.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="HOST.">
  <li data-n="17">Now as I am a true woman, holland of eight shillings an ell. You owe money here besides, Sir John, for your diet and by-drinkings, and money lent you, four and twenty pound.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="FAL.">
  <li data-n="18">He had his part of it, let him pay.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="HOST.">
  <li data-n="19">He? Alas, he is poor, he hath nothing.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="FAL.">
  <li data-n="20">How? Poor? Look upon his face; what call you rich? Let them coin his nose, let them coin his cheeks. I’ll not pay a denier. What, will you make a younker of me? Shall I not take mine ease in mine inn but I shall have my pocket pick’d? I have lost a seal-ring of my grandfather’s worth forty mark.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="HOST.">
  <li data-n="21">O Jesu, I have heard the Prince tell him, I know not how oft, that that ring was copper!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="FAL.">
  <li data-n="22">How? The Prince is a Jack, a sneak-up. ’Sblood, and he were here, I would cudgel him like a dog if he would say so.</li>
  <li class="direction-location">

  <li data-n="24">Yea, two and two, Newgate fashion.</li>

  <li data-n="26">What say’st thou, Mistress Quickly? How doth thy husband? I love him well, he is an honest man.</li>

<ol data-s="PRINCE.">
  <li data-n="29">What say’st thou, Jack?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="FAL.">
  <li data-n="30">The other night I fell asleep here behind the arras and had my pocket pick’d. This house is turn’d bawdy-house, they pick pockets.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="PRINCE.">
  <li data-n="31">What didst thou lose, Jack?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="FAL.">
  <li data-n="32">Wilt thou believe me, Hal, three or four bonds of forty pound a-piece, and a seal-ring of my grandfather’s.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="PRINCE.">
  <li data-n="33">A trifle, some eight-penny matter.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="HOST.">
  <li data-n="34">So I told him, my lord, and I said I heard your Grace say so; and, my lord, he speaks most vilely of you, like a foul-mouth’d man as he is, and said he would cudgel you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="PRINCE.">
  <li data-n="35">What, he did not?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="HOST.">
  <li data-n="36">There’s neither faith, truth, nor womanhood in me else.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="FAL.">
  <li data-n="37">There’s no more faith in thee than in a stew’d prune, nor no more truth in thee than in a drawn fox, and for womanhood, Maid Marian may be the deputy’s wife of the ward to thee. Go, you thing, go.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="HOST.">
  <li data-n="38">Say, what thing? What thing?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="FAL.">
  <li data-n="39">What thing? Why, a thing to thank God on.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="HOST.">
  <li data-n="40">I am no thing to thank God on, I would thou shouldst know it. I am an honest man’s wife, and setting thy knighthood aside, thou art a knave to call me so.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="FAL.">
  <li data-n="41">Setting thy womanhood aside, thou art a beast to say otherwise.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="HOST.">
  <li data-n="42">Say, what beast, thou knave, thou?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="FAL.">
  <li data-n="43">What beast? Why, an otter.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="PRINCE.">
  <li data-n="44">An otter, Sir John, why an otter?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="FAL.">
  <li data-n="45">Why? She’s neither fish nor flesh, a man knows not where to have her.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="HOST.">
  <li data-n="46">Thou art an unjust man in saying so. Thou or any man knows where to have me, thou knave, thou!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="PRINCE.">
  <li data-n="47">Thou say’st true, hostess, and he slanders thee most grossly.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="HOST.">
  <li data-n="48">So he doth you, my lord, and said this other day you ought him a thousand pound.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="PRINCE.">
  <li data-n="49">Sirrah, do I owe you a thousand pound?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="FAL.">
  <li data-n="50">A thousand pound, Hal? A million, thy love is worth a million; thou owest me thy love.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="HOST.">
  <li data-n="51">Nay, my lord, he call’d you Jack, and said he would cudgel you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="FAL.">
  <li data-n="52">Did I, Bardolph?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="BARD.">
  <li data-n="53">Indeed, Sir John, you said so.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="FAL.">
  <li data-n="54">Yea, if he said my ring was copper.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="PRINCE.">
  <li data-n="55">I say ’tis copper. Darest thou be as good as thy word now?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="FAL.">
  <li data-n="56">Why, Hal! Thou knowest, as thou art but man, I dare, but as thou art Prince, I fear thee as I fear the roaring of the lion’s whelp.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="PRINCE.">
  <li data-n="57">And why not as the lion?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="FAL.">
  <li data-n="58">The King himself is to be fear’d as the lion. Dost thou think I’ll fear thee as I fear thy father? Nay, and I do, I pray God my girdle break.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="PRINCE.">
  <li data-n="59">O, if it should, how would thy guts fall about thy knees! But, sirrah, there’s no room for faith, truth, nor honesty in this bosom of thine; it is all fill’d up with guts and midriff. Charge an honest woman with picking thy pocket! Why, thou whoreson, impudent, emboss’d rascal, if there were any thing in thy pocket but tavern-reckonings, memorandums of bawdy-houses, and one poor pennyworth of sugar-candy to make thee long-winded—if thy pocket were enrich’d with any other injuries but these, I am a villain. And yet you will stand to it, you will not pocket up wrong. Art thou not asham’d?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="FAL.">
  <li data-n="60">Dost thou hear, Hal? Thou knowest in the state of innocency Adam fell, and what should poor Jack Falstaff do in the days of villainy? Thou seest I have more flesh than another man, and therefore more frailty. You confess then you pick’d my pocket?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="PRINCE.">

  <li data-n="31">He writes me here, that inward sickness—</li>

  <li data-n="34">To lay so dangerous and dear a trust</li>
  <li data-n="35">On any soul remov’d, but on his own.</li>
  <li data-n="36">Yet doth he give us bold advertisement</li>

  <li data-n="67">May turn the tide of fearful faction,</li>
  <li data-n="68">And breed a kind of question in our cause.</li>
  <li data-n="69">For well you know we of the off’ring side</li>

I press me none but good householders, yeomen’s sons, inquire me out contracted bachelors, such as had been ask’d twice on the banes, such a commodity of warm slaves, as had as lief hear the devil as a drum, such as fear the report of a caliver worse than a struck fowl or a hurt wild duck. I press’d me none but such toasts-and-butter, with hearts in their bellies no bigger than pins’ heads, and they have bought out their services; and now my whole charge consists of ancients, corporals, lieutenants, gentlemen of companies—slaves as ragged as Lazarus in the painted cloth, where the glutton’s dogs lick’d his sores, and such as indeed were never soldiers, but discarded unjust servingmen, younger sons to younger brothers, revolted tapsters, and ostlers trade-fall’n, the cankers of a calm world and a long peace, ten times more dishonorable ragged than an old feaz’d ancient: and such have I, to fill up the rooms of them as have bought out their services, that you would think that I had a hundred and fifty totter’d prodigals lately come from swine-keeping, from eating draff and husks. A mad fellow met me on the way and told me I had unloaded all the gibbets and press’d the dead bodies. No eye hath seen such scarecrows. I’ll not march through Coventry with them, that’s flat. Nay, and the villains march wide betwixt the legs, as if they had gyves on, for indeed I had the most of them out of prison. There’s not a shirt and a half in all my company, and the half shirt is two napkins tack’d together and thrown over the shoulders like a herald’s coat without sleeves; and the shirt, to say the truth, stol’n from my host at Saint Albans, or the red-nose innkeeper of Daventry.

  <li data-n="32">Welcome, Sir Walter Blunt; and would to God</li>

  <li data-n="34">Some of us love you well, and even those some</li>
  <li data-n="35">Envy your great deservings and good name,</li>

  <li data-n="41">But to my charge. The King hath sent to know</li>
  <li data-n="42">The nature of your griefs, and whereupon</li>
  <li data-n="43">You conjure from the breast of civil peace</li>
  <li data-n="44">Such bold hostility, teaching his duteous land</li>
  <li data-n="45">Audacious cruelty. If that the King</li>
  <li data-n="46">Have any way your good deserts forgot,</li>
  <li data-n="47">Which he confesseth to be manifold,</li>

</ol>

<ol data-s="HOT.">
  <li data-n="52">The King is kind, and well we know the King</li>
  <li data-n="53">Knows at what time to promise, when to pay.</li>
  <li data-n="54">My father and my uncle and myself</li>
  <li data-n="55">Did give him that same royalty he wears,</li>
  <li data-n="56">And when he was not six and twenty strong,</li>
  <li data-n="57">Sick in the world’s regard, wretched and low,</li>
  <li data-n="58">A poor unminded outlaw sneaking home,</li>
  <li data-n="59">My father gave him welcome to the shore;</li>
  <li data-n="60">And when he heard him swear and vow to God</li>
  <li data-n="61">He came but to be Duke of Lancaster,</li>
  <li data-n="62">To sue his livery and beg his peace,</li>
  <li data-n="63">With tears of innocency and terms of zeal,</li>
  <li data-n="64">My father, in kind heart and pity mov’d,</li>
  <li data-n="65">Swore him assistance, and perform’d it too.</li>
  <li data-n="66">Now when the lords and barons of the realm</li>
  <li data-n="67">Perceiv’d Northumberland did lean to him,</li>
  <li data-n="68">The more and less came in with cap and knee,</li>
  <li data-n="69">Met him in boroughs, cities, villages,</li>
  <li data-n="70">Attended him on bridges, stood in lanes,</li>
  <li data-n="71">Laid gifts before him, proffer’d him their oaths,</li>
  <li data-n="72">Gave him their heirs as pages, followed him</li>
  <li data-n="73">Even at the heels in golden multitudes.</li>
  <li data-n="74">He presently, as greatness knows itself,</li>
  <li data-n="75">Steps me a little higher than his vow</li>
  <li data-n="76">Made to my father, while his blood was poor,</li>
  <li data-n="77">Upon the naked shore at Ravenspurgh,</li>
  <li data-n="78">And now forsooth takes on him to reform</li>
  <li data-n="79">Some certain edicts and some strait decrees</li>
  <li data-n="80">That lie too heavy on the commonwealth,</li>
  <li data-n="81">Cries out upon abuses, seems to weep</li>
  <li data-n="82">Over his country’s wrongs, and by this face,</li>
  <li data-n="83">This seeming brow of justice, did he win</li>
  <li data-n="84">The hearts of all that he did angle for;</li>
  <li data-n="85">Proceeded further—cut me off the heads</li>
  <li data-n="86">Of all the favorites that the absent King</li>
  <li data-n="87">In deputation left behind him here,</li>
  <li data-n="88">When he was personal in the Irish war.</li>

  <li data-n="89" data-o="5">Then to the point.</li>

  <li data-n="91">Soon after that, depriv’d him of his life,</li>
  <li data-n="92">And in the neck of that, task’d the whole state;</li>
  <li data-n="93">To make that worse, suff’red his kinsman March</li>
  <li data-n="94">(Who is, if every owner were well plac’d,</li>
  <li data-n="95">Indeed his king) to be engag’d in Wales,</li>
  <li data-n="96">There without ransom to lie forfeited;</li>
  <li data-n="97">Disgrac’d me in my happy victories,</li>
  <li data-n="98">Sought to entrap me by intelligence,</li>
  <li data-n="99">Rated mine uncle from the Council-board,</li>
  <li data-n="100">In rage dismiss’d my father from the court,</li>
  <li data-n="101">Broke oath on oath, committed wrong on wrong,</li>
  <li data-n="102">And in conclusion drove us to seek out</li>
  <li data-n="103">This head of safety, and withal to pry</li>
  <li data-n="104">Into his title, the which we find</li>
  <li data-n="105">Too indirect for long continuance.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="BLUNT.">
  <li data-n="106">Shall I return this answer to the King?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="HOT.">
  <li data-n="107">Not so, Sir Walter; we’ll withdraw a while.</li>
  <li data-n="108">Go to the King, and let there be impawn’d</li>
  <li data-n="109">Some surety for a safe return again,</li>

  <li data-n="11">As I am truly given to understand,</li>
  <li data-n="12">The King with mighty and quick-raised power</li>
  <li data-n="13">Meets with Lord Harry; and I fear, Sir Michael,</li>
  <li data-n="14">What with the sickness of Northumberland,</li>
  <li data-n="15">Whose power was in the first proportion,</li>
  <li data-n="16">And what with Owen Glendower’s absence thence,</li>
  <li data-n="17">Who with them was a rated sinew too,</li>

I lie, I am no counterfeit. To die is to be a counterfeit, for he is but the counterfeit of a man who hath not the life of a man; but to counterfeit dying, when a man thereby liveth, is to be no counterfeit, but the true and perfect image of life indeed. The better part of valor is discretion, in the which better part I have sav’d my life. ’Zounds, I am afraid of this gunpowder Percy though he be dead. How if he should counterfeit too and rise? By my faith, I am afraid he would prove the better counterfeit. Therefore I’ll make him sure, yea, and I’ll swear I kill’d him. Why may not he rise as well as I?
