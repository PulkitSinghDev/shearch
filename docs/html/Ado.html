<h3>Scene 1</h3>

<h4>Messina. Before Leonato’s house.</h4>

<div class="stage-direction">
	Enter Leonato, governor of Messina, Hero his daughter, and Beatrice his niece, with a Messenger.
	
		LEON.
		HERO.
		BEAT.
		MESS.
	
</div>

<ol data-s="LEON.">
  <li data-n="1">I learn in this letter that Don Pedro of Arragon comes this night to Messina.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="MESS.">
  <li data-n="2">He is very near by this, he was not three leagues off when I left him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="LEON.">
  <li data-n="3">How many gentlemen have you lost in this action?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="MESS.">
  <li data-n="4">But few of any sort, and none of name.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="LEON.">
  <li data-n="5">A victory is twice itself when the achiever brings home full numbers. I find here that Don Pedro hath bestow’d much honor on a young Florentine call’d Claudio.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="MESS.">
  <li data-n="6">Much deserv’d on his part, and equally rememb’red by Don Pedro. He hath borne himself beyond the promise of his age, doing in the figure of a lamb the feats of a lion. He hath indeed better bett’red expectation than you must expect of me to tell you how.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="LEON.">
  <li data-n="7">He hath an uncle here in Messina will be very much glad of it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="MESS.">
  <li data-n="8">I have already deliver’d him letters, and there appears much joy in him, even so much that joy could not show itself modest enough without a badge of bitterness.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="LEON.">
  <li data-n="9">Did he break out into tears?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="MESS.">
  <li data-n="10">In great measure.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="LEON.">
  <li data-n="11">A kind overflow of kindness. There are no faces truer than those that are so wash’d. How much better is it to weep at joy than to joy at weeping!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="BEAT.">
  <li data-n="12">I pray you, is <foreign xml:lang="it">Signior</foreign> Mountanto return’d from the wars or no?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="MESS.">
  <li data-n="13">I know none of that name, lady. There was none such in the army of any sort.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="LEON.">
  <li data-n="14">What is he that you ask for, niece?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="HERO.">
  <li data-n="15">My cousin means <foreign xml:lang="it">Signior</foreign> Benedick of Padua.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="MESS.">
  <li data-n="16">O, he’s return’d, and as pleasant as ever he was.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="BEAT.">
  <li data-n="17">He set up his bills here in Messina, and challeng’d Cupid at the flight, and my uncle’s fool, reading the challenge, subscrib’d for Cupid, and challeng’d him at the burbolt. I pray you, how many hath he kill’d and eaten in these wars? But how many hath he kill’d? For indeed I promis’d to eat all of his killing.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="LEON.">
  <li data-n="18">Faith, niece, you tax <foreign xml:lang="it">Signior</foreign> Benedick too much, but he’ll be meet with you, I doubt it not.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="MESS.">
  <li data-n="19">He hath done good service, lady, in these wars.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="BEAT.">
  <li data-n="20">You had musty victual, and he hath holp to eat it. He is a very valiant trencherman, he hath an excellent stomach.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="MESS.">
  <li data-n="21">And a good soldier too, lady.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="BEAT.">
  <li data-n="22">And a good soldier to a lady, but what is he to a lord?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="MESS.">
  <li data-n="23">A lord to a lord, a man to a man, stuff’d with all honorable virtues.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="BEAT.">
  <li data-n="24">It is so indeed, he is no less than a stuff’d man. But for the stuffing—well, we are all mortal.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="LEON.">
  <li data-n="25">You must not, sir, mistake my niece. There is a kind of merry war betwixt <foreign xml:lang="it">Signior</foreign> Benedick and her; they never meet but there’s a skirmish of wit between them.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="BEAT.">
  <li data-n="26">Alas, he gets nothing by that. In our last conflict four of his five wits went halting off, and now is the whole man govern’d with one; so that if he have wit enough to keep himself warm, let him bear it for a difference between himself and his horse, for it is all the wealth that he hath left to be known a reasonable creature. Who is his companion now? He hath every month a new sworn brother.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="MESS.">
  <li data-n="27">Is’t possible?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="BEAT.">
  <li data-n="28">Very easily possible. He wears his faith but as the fashion of his hat: it ever changes with the next block.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="MESS.">
  <li data-n="29">I see, lady, the gentleman is not in your books.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="BEAT.">
  <li data-n="30">No, and he were, I would burn my study. But I pray you, who is his companion? Is there no young squarer now that will make a voyage with him to the devil?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="MESS.">
  <li data-n="31">He is most in the company of the right noble Claudio.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="BEAT.">
  <li data-n="32">O Lord, he will hang upon him like a disease; he is sooner caught than the pestilence, and the taker runs presently mad. God help the noble Claudio! If he have caught the Benedick, it will cost him a thousand pound ere ’a be cur’d.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="MESS.">
  <li data-n="33">I will hold friends with you, lady.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="BEAT.">
  <li data-n="34">Do, good friend.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="LEON.">
  <li data-n="35">You will never run mad, niece.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="BEAT.">
  <li data-n="36">No, not till a hot January.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="MESS.">
  <li data-n="37">Don Pedro is approach’d.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">
	Enter Don Pedro, Claudio, Benedick, Balthasar, and Don John the Bastard.
	
		D. PEDRO.

		D. JOHN.
	
</div>

<ol data-s="D. PEDRO.">
  <li data-n="38">Good <foreign xml:lang="it">Signior</foreign> Leonato, are you come to meet your trouble? The fashion of the world is to avoid cost, and you encounter it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="LEON.">
  <li data-n="39">Never came trouble to my house in the likeness of your Grace, for trouble being gone, comfort should remain; but when you depart from me, sorrow abides and happiness takes his leave.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="D. PEDRO.">
  <li data-n="40">You embrace your charge too willingly. I think this is your daughter.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="LEON.">
  <li data-n="41">Her mother hath many times told me so.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="BENE.">
  <li data-n="42">Were you in doubt, sir, that you ask’d her?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="LEON.">
  <li data-n="43"><foreign xml:lang="it">Signior</foreign> Benedick, no, for then were you a child.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="D. PEDRO.">
  <li data-n="44">You have it full, Benedick. We may guess by this what you are, being a man. Truly the lady fathers herself. Be happy, lady, for you are like an honorable father.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="BENE.">
  <li data-n="45">If <foreign xml:lang="it">Signior</foreign> Leonato be her father, she would not have his head on her shoulders for all Messina, as like him as she is.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="BEAT.">
  <li data-n="46">I wonder that you will still be talking, <foreign xml:lang="it">Signior</foreign> Benedick, nobody marks you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="BENE.">
  <li data-n="47">What, my dear Lady Disdain! Are you yet living?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="BEAT.">
  <li data-n="48">Is it possible disdain should die while she hath such meet food to feed it as <foreign xml:lang="it">Signior</foreign> Benedick? Courtesy itself must convert to disdain, if you come in her presence.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="BENE.">
  <li data-n="49">Then is courtesy a turncoat. But it is certain I am lov’d of all ladies, only you excepted; and I would I could find in my heart that I had not a hard heart, for truly I love none.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="BEAT.">
  <li data-n="50">A dear happiness to women, they would else have been troubled with a pernicious suitor. I thank God and my cold blood, I am of your humor for that: I had rather hear my dog bark at a crow than a man swear he loves me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="BENE.">
  <li data-n="51">God keep your ladyship still in that mind! So some gentleman or other shall scape a predestinate scratch’d face.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="BEAT.">
  <li data-n="52">Scratching could not make it worse, and ’twere such a face as yours were.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="BENE.">
  <li data-n="53">Well, you are a rare parrot-teacher.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="BEAT.">
  <li data-n="54">A bird of my tongue is better than a beast of yours.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="BENE.">
  <li data-n="55">I would my horse had the speed of your tongue, and so good a continuer. But keep your way a’ God’s name, I have done.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="BEAT.">
  <li data-n="56">You always end with a jade’s trick, I know you of old.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="D. PEDRO.">
  <li data-n="57">That is the sum of all: Leonato—<foreign xml:lang="it">Signior</foreign> Claudio and <foreign xml:lang="it">Signior</foreign> Benedick—my dear friend Leonato hath invited you all. I tell him we shall stay here at the least a month, and he heartily prays some occasion may detain us longer. I dare swear he is no hypocrite, but prays from his heart.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="LEON.">
  <li data-n="58">If you swear, my lord, you shall not be forsworn.</li>

<ol data-s="CLAUD.">
  <li data-n="63">Benedick, didst thou note the daughter of <foreign xml:lang="it">Signior</foreign> Leonato?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="BENE.">
  <li data-n="64">I noted her not, but I look’d on her.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="CLAUD.">
  <li data-n="65">Is she not a modest young lady?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="BENE.">
  <li data-n="66">Do you question me, as an honest man should do, for my simple true judgment? Or would you have me speak after my custom, as being a profess’d tyrant to their sex?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="CLAUD.">
  <li data-n="67">No, I pray thee speak in sober judgment.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="BENE.">
  <li data-n="68">Why, i’ faith, methinks she’s too low for a high praise, too brown for a fair praise, and too little for a great praise; only this commendation I can afford her, that were she other than she is, she were unhandsome, and being no other but as she is, I do not like her.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="CLAUD.">
  <li data-n="69">Thou thinkest I am in sport. I pray thee tell me truly how thou lik’st her.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="BENE.">
  <li data-n="70">Would you buy her, that you inquire after her?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="CLAUD.">
  <li data-n="71">Can the world buy such a jewel?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="BENE.">
  <li data-n="72">Yea, and a case to put it into. But speak you this with a sad brow? Or do you play the flouting Jack, to tell us Cupid is a good hare-finder and Vulcan a rare carpenter? Come, in what key shall a man take you to go in the song?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="CLAUD.">
  <li data-n="73">In mine eye, she is the sweetest lady that ever I look’d on.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="BENE.">
  <li data-n="74">I can see yet without spectacles, and I see no such matter. There’s her cousin, and she were not possess’d with a fury, exceeds her as much in beauty as the first of May doth the last of December. But I hope you have no intent to turn husband, have you?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="CLAUD.">
  <li data-n="75">I would scarce trust myself, though I had sworn the contrary, if Hero would be my wife.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="BENE.">
  <li data-n="76">Is’t come to this? In faith, hath not the world one man but he will wear his cap with suspicion? Shall I never see a bachelor of threescore again? Go to, i’ faith, and thou wilt needs thrust thy neck into a yoke, wear the print of it, and sigh away Sundays. Look, Don Pedro is return’d to seek you.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">
	Enter Don Pedro.
	
		D. PEDRO.
	
</div>

<ol data-s="D. PEDRO.">
  <li data-n="77">What secret hath held you here, that you follow’d not to Leonato’s?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="BENE.">
  <li data-n="78">I would your Grace would constrain me to tell.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="D. PEDRO.">
  <li data-n="79">I charge thee on thy allegiance.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="BENE.">
  <li data-n="80">You hear, Count Claudio, I can be secret as a dumb man; I would have you think so; but on my allegiance, mark you this, on my allegiance, he is in love. With who? Now that is your Grace’s part. Mark how short his answer is: with Hero, Leonato’s short daughter.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="CLAUD.">
  <li data-n="81">If this were so, so were it utt’red.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="BENE.">
  <li data-n="82">Like the old tale, my lord: “It is not so, nor ’twas not so, but indeed, God forbid it should be so.”</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="CLAUD.">
  <li data-n="83">If my passion change not shortly, God forbid it should be otherwise.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="D. PEDRO.">
  <li data-n="84">Amen, if you love her, for the lady is very well worthy.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="CLAUD.">
  <li data-n="85">You speak this to fetch me in, my lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="D. PEDRO.">
  <li data-n="86">By my troth, I speak my thought.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="CLAUD.">
  <li data-n="87">And in faith, my lord, I spoke mine.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="BENE.">
  <li data-n="88">And by my two faiths and troths, my lord, I spoke mine.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="CLAUD.">
  <li data-n="89">That I love her, I feel.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="D. PEDRO.">
  <li data-n="90">That she is worthy, I know.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="BENE.">
  <li data-n="91">That I neither feel how she should be lov’d, nor know how she should be worthy, is the opinion that fire cannot melt out of me; I will die in it at the stake.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="D. PEDRO.">
  <li data-n="92">Thou wast ever an obstinate heretic in the despite of beauty.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="CLAUD.">
  <li data-n="93">And never could maintain his part but in the force of his will.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="BENE.">
  <li data-n="94">That a woman conceiv’d me, I thank her; that she brought me up, I likewise give her most humble thanks; but that I will have a rechate winded in my forehead, or hang my bugle in an invisible baldrick, all women shall pardon me. Because I will not do them the wrong to mistrust any, I will do myself the right to trust none; and the fine is (for the which I may go the finer), I will live a bachelor.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="D. PEDRO.">
  <li data-n="95">I shall see thee, ere I die, look pale with love.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="BENE.">
  <li data-n="96">With anger, with sickness, or with hunger, my lord, not with love. Prove that ever I lose more blood with love than I will get again with drinking, pick out mine eyes with a ballad-maker’s pen, and hang me up at the door of a brothel-house for the sign of blind Cupid.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="D. PEDRO.">
  <li data-n="97">Well, if ever thou dost fall from this faith, thou wilt prove a notable argument.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="BENE.">
  <li data-n="98">If I do, hang me in a bottle like a cat, and shoot at me, and he that hits me, let him be clapp’d on the shoulder, and call’d Adam.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="D. PEDRO.">
  <li data-n="99">Well, as time shall try:</li>
  <li data-n="100">“In time the savage bull doth bear the yoke.”</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="BENE.">
  <li data-n="101">The savage bull may, but if ever the sensible Benedick bear it, pluck off the bull’s horns, and set them in my forehead, and let me be vildly painted, and in such great letters as they write “Here is good horse to hire,” let them signify under my sign, “Here you may see Benedick the married man.”</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="CLAUD.">
  <li data-n="102">If this should ever happen, thou wouldst be horn-mad.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="D. PEDRO.">
  <li data-n="103">Nay, if Cupid have not spent all his quiver in Venice, thou wilt quake for this shortly.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="BENE.">
  <li data-n="104">I look for an earthquake too then.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="D. PEDRO.">
  <li data-n="105">Well, you will temporize with the hours. In the mean time, good <foreign xml:lang="it">Signior</foreign> Benedick, repair to Leonato’s, commend me to him, and tell him I will not fail him at supper, for indeed he hath made great preparation.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="BENE.">
  <li data-n="106">I have almost matter enough in me for such an embassage, and so I commit you—</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="CLAUD.">
  <li data-n="107">To the tuition of God. From my house—if I had it—</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="D. PEDRO.">
  <li data-n="108">The sixth of July. Your loving friend, Benedick.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="BENE.">
  <li data-n="109">Nay, mock not, mock not. The body of your discourse is sometime guarded with fragments, and the guards are but slightly basted on neither. Ere you flout old ends any further, examine your conscience, and so I leave you.</li>

  <li data-n="111">My love is thine to teach; teach it but how,</li>
  <li data-n="112">And thou shalt see how apt it is to learn</li>
  <li data-n="113">Any hard lesson that may do thee good.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="CLAUD.">
  <li data-n="114">Hath Leonato any son, my lord?</li>

  <li data-n="117">O my lord,</li>
  <li data-n="118">When you went onward on this ended action,</li>
  <li data-n="119">I look’d upon her with a soldier’s eye,</li>
  <li data-n="120">That lik’d, but had a rougher task in hand</li>
  <li data-n="121">Than to drive liking to the name of love.</li>
  <li data-n="122">But now I am return’d, and that war-thoughts</li>
  <li data-n="123">Have left their places vacant, in their rooms</li>
  <li data-n="124">Come thronging soft and delicate desires,</li>
  <li data-n="125">All prompting me how fair young Hero is,</li>
  <li data-n="126">Saying I lik’d her ere I went to wars.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="D. PEDRO.">
  <li data-n="127">Thou wilt be like a lover presently,</li>
  <li data-n="128">And tire the hearer with a book of words.</li>
  <li data-n="129">If thou dost love fair Hero, cherish it,</li>
  <li data-n="130">And I will break with her, and with her father,</li>
  <li data-n="131">And thou shalt have her. Was’t not to this end</li>
  <li data-n="132">That thou began’st to twist so fine a story?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="CLAUD.">
  <li data-n="133">How sweetly you do minister to love,</li>
  <li data-n="134">That know love’s grief by his complexion!</li>
  <li data-n="135">But lest my liking might too sudden seem,</li>
  <li data-n="136">I would have salv’d it with a longer treatise.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="D. PEDRO.">
  <li data-n="137">What need the bridge much broader than the flood?</li>
  <li data-n="138">The fairest grant is the necessity.</li>
  <li data-n="139">Look what will serve is fit: ’tis once, thou lovest,</li>
  <li data-n="140">And I will fit thee with the remedy.</li>
  <li data-n="141">I know we shall have reveling tonight;</li>
  <li data-n="142">I will assume thy part in some disguise,</li>
  <li data-n="143">And tell fair Hero I am Claudio,</li>
  <li data-n="144">And in her bosom I’ll unclasp my heart,</li>
  <li data-n="145">And take her hearing prisoner with the force</li>
  <li data-n="146">And strong encounter of my amorous tale;</li>
  <li data-n="147">Then after to her father will I break,</li>
  <li data-n="148">And the conclusion is, she shall be thine.</li>

<h4>A room in Leonato’s house.</h4>

<div class="stage-direction">
	Enter Leonato and an old man Antonio, brother to Leonato, meeting.

		ANT.
	
</div>

<ol data-s="LEON.">
  <li data-n="1">How now, brother, where is my cousin, your son? Hath he provided this music?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ANT.">
  <li data-n="2">He is very busy about it. But, brother, I can tell you strange news that you yet dreamt not of.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="LEON.">
  <li data-n="3">Are they good?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ANT.">
  <li data-n="4">As the event stamps them, but they have a good cover; they show well outward. The Prince and Count Claudio, walking in a thick-pleach’d alley in mine orchard, were thus much overheard by a man of mine. The Prince discover’d to Claudio that he lov’d my niece your daughter, and meant to acknowledge it this night in a dance; and if he found her accordant, he meant to take the present time by the top, and instantly break with you of it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="LEON.">

<h3>Scene 3</h3>

<h4>A hall in Leonato’s house.</h4>

<div class="stage-direction">
	Enter Don John the Bastard and Conrade, his companion.
	
		D. JOHN.
		CON.
	
</div>

<ol data-s="CON.">
  <li data-n="1">What the good-year, my lord, why are you thus out of measure sad?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="D. JOHN.">
  <li data-n="2">There is no measure in the occasion that breeds, therefore the sadness is without limit.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="CON.">
  <li data-n="3">You should hear reason.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="D. JOHN.">
  <li data-n="4">And when I have heard it, what blessing brings it?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="CON.">
  <li data-n="5">If not a present remedy, at least a patient sufferance.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="D. JOHN.">
  <li data-n="6">I wonder that thou (being, as thou say’st thou art, born under Saturn) goest about to apply a moral medicine to a mortifying mischief. I cannot hide what I am: I must be sad when I have cause, and smile at no man’s jests; eat when I have stomach, and wait for no man’s leisure; sleep when I am drowsy, and tend on no man’s business; laugh when I am merry, and claw no man in his humor.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="CON.">
  <li data-n="7">Yea, but you must not make the full show of this till you may do it without controlment. You have of late stood out against your brother, and he hath ta’en you newly into his grace, where it is impossible you should take true root but by the fair weather that you make yourself. It is needful that you frame the season for your own harvest.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="D. JOHN.">
  <li data-n="8">I had rather be a canker in a hedge than a rose in his grace, and it better fits my blood to be disdain’d of all than to fashion a carriage to rob love from any. In this (though I cannot be said to be a flattering honest man) it must not be denied but I am a plain-dealing villain. I am trusted with a muzzle, and enfranchis’d with a clog, therefore I have decreed not to sing in my cage. If I had my mouth, I would bite; if I had my liberty, I would do my liking. In the mean time let me be that I am, and seek not to alter me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="CON.">
  <li data-n="9">Can you make no use of your discontent?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="D. JOHN.">
  <li data-n="10">I make all use of it, for I use it only. Who comes here?</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">
	Enter Borachio.
	
		BORA.
	
</li>
  <li data-n="11">What news, Borachio?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="BORA.">
  <li data-n="12">I came yonder from a great supper. The Prince your brother is royally entertain’d by Leonato, and I can give you intelligence of an intended marriage.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="D. JOHN.">
  <li data-n="13">Will it serve for any model to build mischief on? What is he for a fool that betroths himself to unquietness?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="BORA.">
  <li data-n="14">Marry, it is your brother’s right hand.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="D. JOHN.">
  <li data-n="15">Who, the most exquisite Claudio?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="BORA.">
  <li data-n="16">Even he.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="D. JOHN.">
  <li data-n="17">A proper squire! And who, and who? Which way looks he?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="BORA.">
  <li data-n="18">Marry, one Hero, the daughter and heir of Leonato.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="D. JOHN.">
  <li data-n="19">A very forward March-chick! How came you to this?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="BORA.">
  <li data-n="20">Being entertain’d for a perfumer, as I was smoking a musty room, comes me the Prince and Claudio, hand in hand in sad conference. I whipt me behind the arras, and there heard it agreed upon that the Prince should woo Hero for himself, and having obtain’d her, give her to Count Claudio.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="D. JOHN.">
  <li data-n="21">Come, come, let us thither, this may prove food to my displeasure. That young start-up hath all the glory of my overthrow. If I can cross him any way, I bless myself every way. You are both sure, and will assist me?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="CON.">
  <li data-n="22">To the death, my lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="D. JOHN.">
  <li data-n="23">Let us to the great supper, their cheer is the greater that I am subdu’d. Would the cook were a’ my mind! Shall we go prove what’s to be done?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="BORA.">
  <li data-n="24">We’ll wait upon your lordship.</li>

<ol data-s="ANT.">
  <li data-n="2">I saw him not.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="BEAT.">
  <li data-n="3">How tartly that gentleman looks! I never can see him but I am heart-burn’d an hour after.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="HERO.">
  <li data-n="4">He is of a very melancholy disposition.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="BEAT.">
  <li data-n="5">He were an excellent man that were made just in the midway between him and Benedick: the one is too like an image and says nothing, and the other too like my lady’s eldest son, evermore tattling.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="LEON.">
  <li data-n="6">Then half <foreign xml:lang="it">Signior</foreign> Benedick’s tongue in Count John’s mouth, and half Count John’s melancholy in <foreign xml:lang="it">Signior</foreign> Benedick’s face—</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="BEAT.">
  <li data-n="7">With a good leg and a good foot, uncle, and money enough in his purse, such a man would win any woman in the world, if ’a could get her good will.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="LEON.">
  <li data-n="8">By my troth, niece, thou wilt never get thee a husband, if thou be so shrewd of thy tongue.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ANT.">
  <li data-n="9">In faith, she’s too curst.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="BEAT.">
  <li data-n="10">Too curst is more than curst. I shall lessen God’s sending that way, for it is said, “God sends a curst cow short horns”—but to a cow too curst he sends none.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="LEON.">
  <li data-n="11">So, by being too curst, God will send you no horns.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="BEAT.">
  <li data-n="12">Just, if he send me no husband, for the which blessing I am at him upon my knees every morning and evening. Lord, I could not endure a husband with a beard on his face, I had rather lie in the woollen!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="LEON.">
  <li data-n="13">You may light on a husband that hath no beard.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="BEAT.">
  <li data-n="14">What should I do with him? Dress him in my apparel and make him my waiting-gentlewoman? He that hath a beard is more than a youth, and he that hath no beard is less than a man; and he that is more than a youth is not for me, and he that is less than a man, I am not for him; therefore I will even take sixpence in earnest of the berrord, and lead his apes into hell.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="LEON.">
  <li data-n="15">Well then, go you into hell.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="BEAT.">
  <li data-n="16">No, but to the gate, and there will the devil meet me like an old cuckold with horns on his head, and say, “Get you to heaven, Beatrice, get you to heaven, here’s no place for you maids.” So deliver I up my apes, and away to Saint Peter. For the heavens, he shows me where the bachelors sit, and there live we as merry as the day is long.</li>

</li>
  <li data-n="17">Well, niece, I trust you will be rul’d by your father.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="BEAT.">
  <li data-n="18">Yes, faith, it is my cousin’s duty to make cur’sy and say, “Father, as it please you.” But yet for all that, cousin, let him be a handsome fellow, or else make another cur’sy and say, “Father, as it please me.”</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="LEON.">
  <li data-n="19">Well, niece, I hope to see you one day fitted with a husband.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="BEAT.">
  <li data-n="20">Not till God make men of some other mettle than earth. Would it not grieve a woman to be overmaster’d with a piece of valiant dust? To make an account of her life to a clod of wayward marl? No, uncle, I’ll none. Adam’s sons are my brethren, and truly I hold it a sin to match in my kindred.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="LEON.">
  <li data-n="21">Daughter, remember what I told you. If the Prince do solicit you in that kind, you know your answer.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="BEAT.">
  <li data-n="22">The fault will be in the music, cousin, if you be not woo’d in good time. If the Prince be too important, tell him there is measure in every thing, and so dance out the answer. For hear me, Hero: wooing, wedding, and repenting, is as a Scotch jig, a measure, and a cinquepace; the first suit is hot and hasty, like a Scotch jig, and full as fantastical; the wedding, mannerly-modest, as a measure, full of state and ancientry; and then comes repentance, and with his bad legs falls into the cinquepace faster and faster, till he sink into his grave.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="LEON.">
  <li data-n="23">Cousin, you apprehend passing shrewdly.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="BEAT.">
  <li data-n="24">I have a good eye, uncle, I can see a church by daylight.</li>

She told me, not thinking I had been myself, that I was the Prince’s jester, that I was duller than a great thaw, huddling jest upon jest with such impossible conveyance upon me that I stood like a man at a mark, with a whole army shooting at me. She speaks poniards, and every word stabs. If her breath were as terrible as her terminations, there were no living near her, she would infect to the north star. I would not marry her, though she were endow’d with all that Adam had left him before he transgress’d. She would have made Hercules have turn’d spit, yea, and have cleft his club to make the fire too. Come, talk not of her; you shall find her the infernal Ate in good apparel. I would to God some scholar would conjure her, for certainly, while she is here, a man may live as quiet in hell as in a sanctuary, and people sin upon purpose, because they would go thither; so indeed all disquiet, horror, and perturbation follows her.</li>

They will scarcely believe this without trial. Offer them instances, which shall bear no less likelihood than to see me at her chamber-window, hear me call Margaret Hero, hear Margaret term me Claudio; and bring them to see this the very night, before the intended wedding—for in the mean time I will so fashion the matter that Hero shall be absent—and there shall appear such seeming truth of Hero’s disloyalty, that jealousy shall be call’d assurance, and all the preparation overthrown.</li>

I have known when there was no music with him but the drum and the fife, and now had he rather hear the tabor and the pipe; I have known when he would have walk’d ten mile afoot to see a good armor, and now will he lie ten nights awake carving the fashion of a new doublet; he was wont to speak plain and to the purpose (like an honest man and a soldier), and now is he turn’d orthography—his words are a very fantastical banquet, just so many strange dishes. May I be so converted and see with these eyes? I cannot tell; I think not. I will not be sworn but love may transform me to an oyster, but I’ll take my oath on it, till he have made an oyster of me, he shall never make me such a fool. One woman is fair, yet I am well; another is wise, yet I am well; another virtuous, yet I am well; but till all graces be in one woman, one woman shall not come in my grace. Rich she shall be, that’s certain; wise, or I’ll none; virtuous, or I’ll never cheapen her; fair, or I’ll never look on her; mild, or come not near me; noble, or not I for an angel; of good discourse, an excellent musician, and her hair shall be of what color it please God.

<ol data-s="CLAUD.">
  <li data-n="71">Then down upon her knees she falls, weeps, sobs, beats her heart, tears her hair, prays, curses: “O sweet Benedick! God give me patience!”</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="LEON.">
  <li data-n="72">She doth indeed, my daughter says so; and the ecstasy hath so much overborne her that my daughter is sometime afeard she will do a desperate outrage to herself. It is very true.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="D. PEDRO.">
  <li data-n="73">It were good that Benedick knew of it by some other, if she will not discover it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="CLAUD.">
  <li data-n="74">To what end? He would make but a sport of it, and torment the poor lady worse.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="D. PEDRO.">
  <li data-n="75">And he should, it were an alms to hang him. She’s an excellent sweet lady, and (out of all suspicion) she is virtuous.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="CLAUD.">
  <li data-n="76">And she is exceeding wise.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="D. PEDRO.">
  <li data-n="77">In every thing but in loving Benedick.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="LEON.">
  <li data-n="78">O my lord, wisdom and blood combating in so tender a body, we have ten proofs to one that blood hath the victory. I am sorry for her, as I have just cause, being her uncle and her guardian.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="D. PEDRO.">
  <li data-n="79">I would she had bestow’d this dotage on me, I would have daff’d all other respects, and made her half myself. I pray you tell Benedick of it, and hear what ’a will say.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="LEON.">
  <li data-n="80">Were it good, think you?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="CLAUD.">
  <li data-n="81">Hero thinks surely she will die, for she says she will die if he love her not, and she will die ere she make her love known, and she will die if he woo her, rather than she will bate one breath of her accustom’d crossness.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="D. PEDRO.">
  <li data-n="82">She doth well. If she should make tender of her love, ’tis very possible he’ll scorn it, for the man (as you know all) hath a contemptible spirit.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="CLAUD.">
  <li data-n="83">He is a very proper man.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="D. PEDRO.">
  <li data-n="84">He hath indeed a good outward happiness.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="CLAUD.">
  <li data-n="85">Before God, and in my mind, very wise.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="D. PEDRO.">
  <li data-n="86">He doth indeed show some sparks that are like wit.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="CLAUD.">
  <li data-n="87">And I take him to be valiant.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="D. PEDRO.">
  <li data-n="88">As Hector, I assure you, and in the managing of quarrels you may say he is wise, for either he avoids them with great discretion, or undertakes them with a most Christian-like fear.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="LEON.">
  <li data-n="89">If he do fear God, ’a must necessarily keep peace; if he break the peace, he ought to enter into a quarrel with fear and trembling.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="D. PEDRO.">
  <li data-n="90">And so will he do, for the man doth fear God, howsoever it seems not in him by some large jests he will make. Well, I am sorry for your niece. Shall we go seek Benedick, and tell him of her love?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="CLAUD.">
  <li data-n="91">Never tell him, my lord. Let her wear it out with good counsel.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="LEON.">
  <li data-n="92">Nay, that’s impossible, she may wear her heart out first.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="D. PEDRO.">
  <li data-n="93">Well, we will hear further of it by your daughter, let it cool the while. I love Benedick well, and I could wish he would modestly examine himself, to see how much he is unworthy so good a lady.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="LEON.">

  <li data-n="97">This can be no trick: the conference was sadly borne; they have the truth of this from Hero; they seem to pity the lady. It seems her affections have their full bent. Love me? Why, it must be requited. I hear how I am censur’d; they say I will bear myself proudly, if I perceive the love come from her; they say too that she will rather die than give any sign of affection. I did never think to marry. I must not seem proud; happy are they that hear their detractions, and can put them to mending. They say the lady is fair; ’tis a truth, I can bear them witness; and virtuous; ’tis so, I cannot reprove it; and wise, but for loving me; by my troth, it is no addition to her wit, nor no great argument of her folly, for I will be horribly in love with her. I may chance have some odd quirks and remnants of wit broken on me, because I have rail’d so long against marriage; but doth not the appetite alter? A man loves the meat in his youth that he cannot endure in his age. Shall quips and sentences and these paper bullets of the brain awe a man from the career of his humor? No, the world must be peopled. When I said I would die a bachelor, I did not think I should live till I were married. Here comes Beatrice. By this day, she’s a fair lady. I do spy some marks of love in her.</li>

  <li data-n="38">So says the Prince and my new-trothed lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="URS.">
  <li data-n="39">And did they bid you tell her of it, madam?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="HERO.">
  <li data-n="40">They did entreat me to acquaint her of it,</li>
  <li data-n="41">But I persuaded them, if they lov’d Benedick,</li>
  <li data-n="42">To wish him wrestle with affection,</li>
  <li data-n="43">And never to let Beatrice know of it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="URS.">
  <li data-n="44">Why did you so? Doth not the gentleman</li>
  <li data-n="45">Deserve as full as fortunate a bed</li>
  <li data-n="46">As ever Beatrice shall couch upon?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="HERO.">
  <li data-n="47">O god of love! I know he doth deserve</li>
  <li data-n="48">As much as may be yielded to a man;</li>
  <li data-n="49">But nature never fram’d a woman’s heart</li>
  <li data-n="50">Of prouder stuff than that of Beatrice.</li>
  <li data-n="51">Disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes,</li>
  <li data-n="52">Misprising what they look on, and her wit</li>
  <li data-n="53">Values itself so highly that to her</li>
  <li data-n="54">All matter else seems weak. She cannot love,</li>
  <li data-n="55">Nor take no shape nor project of affection,</li>
  <li data-n="56">She is so self-endeared.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="URS.">
  <li data-n="56" data-o="5">Sure I think so,</li>
  <li data-n="57">And therefore certainly it were not good</li>
  <li data-n="58">She knew his love, lest she’ll make sport at it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="HERO.">
  <li data-n="59">Why, you speak truth. I never yet saw man,</li>
  <li data-n="60">How wise, how noble, young, how rarely featur’d,</li>
  <li data-n="61">But she would spell him backward. If fair-fac’d,</li>
  <li data-n="62">She would swear the gentleman should be her sister;</li>
  <li data-n="63">If black, why, Nature, drawing of an antic,</li>
  <li data-n="64">Made a foul blot; if tall, a lance ill-headed;</li>
  <li data-n="65">If low, an agot very vildly cut;</li>
  <li data-n="66">If speaking, why, a vane blown with all winds;</li>
  <li data-n="67">If silent, why, a block moved with none.</li>
  <li data-n="68">So turns she every man the wrong side out,</li>
  <li data-n="69">And never gives to truth and virtue that</li>
  <li data-n="70">Which simpleness and merit purchaseth.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="URS.">
  <li data-n="71">Sure, sure, such carping is not commendable.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="HERO.">
  <li data-n="72">No, not to be so odd, and from all fashions,</li>
  <li data-n="73">As Beatrice is, cannot be commendable.</li>
  <li data-n="74">But who dare tell her so? If I should speak,</li>
  <li data-n="75">She would mock me into air; O, she would laugh me</li>
  <li data-n="76">Out of myself, press me to death with wit.</li>
  <li data-n="77">Therefore let Benedick, like cover’d fire,</li>
  <li data-n="78">Consume away in sighs, waste inwardly.</li>
  <li data-n="79">It were a better death than die with mocks,</li>
  <li data-n="80">Which is as bad as die with tickling.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="URS.">
  <li data-n="81">Yet tell her of it, hear what she will say.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="HERO.">
  <li data-n="82">No, rather I will go to Benedick,</li>
  <li data-n="83">And counsel him to fight against his passion,</li>
  <li data-n="84">And truly I’ll devise some honest slanders</li>
  <li data-n="85">To stain my cousin with. One doth not know</li>
  <li data-n="86">How much an ill word may empoison liking.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Messina. A street.</h4>

<div class="stage-direction">
	Enter Dogberry and his compartner Verges with the Watch.
	
		DOG.
		VERG.
		1. WATCH.
		2. WATCH.
	
</div>

<ol data-s="DOG.">
  <li data-n="1">Are you good men and true?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="VERG.">
  <li data-n="2">Yea, or else it were pity but they should suffer salvation, body and soul.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="DOG.">
  <li data-n="3">Nay, that were a punishment too good for them, if they should have any allegiance in them, being chosen for the Prince’s watch.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="VERG.">
  <li data-n="4">Well, give them their charge, neighbor Dogberry.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="DOG.">
  <li data-n="5">First, who think you the most desartless man to be constable?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="1. WATCH.">
  <li data-n="6">Hugh Oatcake, sir, or George Seacole, for they can write and read.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="DOG.">
  <li data-n="7">Come hither, neighbor Seacole. God hath blest you with a good name. To be a well-favor’d man is the gift of fortune, but to write and read comes by nature.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="2. WATCH.">
  <li data-n="8">Both which, Master Constable—</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="DOG.">
  <li data-n="9">You have: I knew it would be your answer. Well, for your favor, sir, why, give God thanks, and make no boast of it, and for your writing and reading, let that appear when there is no need of such vanity. You are thought here to be the most senseless and fit man for the constable of the watch; therefore bear you the lantern. This is your charge: you shall comprehend all vagrom men; you are to bid any man stand, in the Prince’s name.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="2. WATCH.">
  <li data-n="10">How if ’a will not stand?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="DOG.">
  <li data-n="11">Why then take no note of him, but let him go, and presently call the rest of the watch together, and thank God you are rid of a knave.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="VERG.">
  <li data-n="12">If he will not stand when he is bidden, he is none of the Prince’s subjects.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="DOG.">
  <li data-n="13">True, and they are to meddle with none but the Prince’s subjects. You shall also make no noise in the streets; for, for the watch to babble and to talk, is most tolerable, and not to be endur’d.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="2. WATCH.">
  <li data-n="14">We will rather sleep than talk, we know what belongs to a watch.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="DOG.">
  <li data-n="15">Why, you speak like an ancient and most quiet watchman, for I cannot see how sleeping should offend; only have a care that your bills be not stol’n. Well, you are to call at all the alehouses, and bid those that are drunk get them to bed.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="2. WATCH.">
  <li data-n="16">How if they will not?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="DOG.">
  <li data-n="17">Why then let them alone till they are sober. If they make you not then the better answer, you may say they are not the men you took them for.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="2. WATCH.">
  <li data-n="18">Well, sir.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="DOG.">
  <li data-n="19">If you meet a thief, you may suspect him, by virtue of your office, to be no true man; and for such kind of men, the less you meddle or make with them, why, the more is for your honesty.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="2. WATCH.">
  <li data-n="20">If we know him to be a thief, shall we not lay hands on him?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="DOG.">
  <li data-n="21">Truly by your office you may, but I think they that touch pitch will be defil’d. The most peaceable way for you, if you do take a thief, is to let him show himself what he is, and steal out of your company.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="VERG.">
  <li data-n="22">You have been always call’d a merciful man, partner.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="DOG.">
  <li data-n="23">Truly, I would not hang a dog by my will, much more a man who hath any honesty in him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="VERG.">
  <li data-n="24">If you hear a child cry in the night, you must call to the nurse and bid her still it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="2. WATCH.">
  <li data-n="25">How if the nurse be asleep and will not hear us?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="DOG.">
  <li data-n="26">Why then depart in peace, and let the child wake her with crying, for the ewe that will not hear her lamb when it baes will never answer a calf when he bleats.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="VERG.">
  <li data-n="27">’Tis very true.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="DOG.">
  <li data-n="28">This is the end of the charge: you, constable, are to present the Prince’s own person. If you meet the Prince in the night, you may stay him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="VERG.">
  <li data-n="29">Nay, by’r lady, that I think ’a cannot.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="DOG.">
  <li data-n="30">Five shillings to one on’t, with any man that knows the statutes, he may stay him; marry, not without the Prince be willing, for indeed the watch ought to offend no man, and it is an offense to stay a man against his will.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="VERG.">
  <li data-n="31">By’r lady, I think it be so.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="DOG.">
  <li data-n="32">Ha, ah ha! Well, masters, good night. And there be any matter of weight chances, call up me. Keep your fellows’ counsels and your own, and good night. Come, neighbor.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="2. WATCH.">
  <li data-n="33">Well, masters, we hear our charge. Let us go sit here upon the church-bench till two, and then all to bed.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="DOG.">
  <li data-n="34">One word more, honest neighbors. I pray you watch about <foreign xml:lang="it">Signior</foreign> Leonato’s door, for the wedding being there tomorrow, there is a great coil tonight. <foreign xml:lang="fr">Adieu</foreign>! Be vigitant, I beseech you.</li>

  <li data-n="43">Therefore know I have earn’d of Don John a thousand ducats.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="CON.">
  <li data-n="44">Is it possible that any villainy should be so dear?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="BORA.">
  <li data-n="45">Thou shouldst rather ask if it were possible any villainy should be so rich; for when rich villains have need of poor ones, poor ones may make what price they will.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="CON.">
  <li data-n="46">I wonder at it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="BORA.">
  <li data-n="47">That shows thou art unconfirm’d. Thou knowest that the fashion of a doublet, or a hat, or a cloak, is nothing to a man.</li>

  <li data-n="48">Yes, it is apparel.</li>

<ol data-s="BORA.">
  <li data-n="51">Tush, I may as well say the fool’s the fool. But seest thou not what a deformed thief this fashion is?</li>

<ol data-s="2. WATCH.">
  <li class="stage-direction">
	Aside.
	
		2. WATCH
	
</li>
  <li data-n="52">I know that Deformed; ’a has been a vile thief this seven year; ’a goes up and down like a gentleman. I remember his name.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="BORA.">
  <li data-n="53">Didst thou not hear somebody?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="CON.">
  <li data-n="54">No, ’twas the vane on the house.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="BORA.">
  <li data-n="55">Seest thou not, I say, what a deformed thief this fashion is, how giddily ’a turns about all the hot-bloods between fourteen and five-and-thirty, sometimes fashioning them like Pharaoh’s soldiers in the reechy painting, sometime like god Bel’s priests in the old church-window, sometime like the shaven Hercules in the smirch’d worm-eaten tapestry, where his codpiece seems as massy as his club?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="CON.">
  <li data-n="56">All this I see, and I see that the fashion wears out more apparel than the man. But art not thou thyself giddy with the fashion too, that thou hast shifted out of thy tale into telling me of the fashion?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="BORA.">
  <li data-n="57">Not so neither, but know that I have tonight woo’d Margaret, the Lady Hero’s gentlewoman, by the name of Hero. She leans me out at her mistress’ chamber-window, bids me a thousand times good night—I tell this tale vildly, I should first tell thee how the Prince, Claudio, and my master, planted and plac’d and possess’d by my master Don John, saw afar off in the orchard this amiable encounter.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="CON.">
  <li data-n="58">And thought they Margaret was Hero?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="BORA.">
  <li data-n="59">Two of them did, the Prince and Claudio, but the devil my master knew she was Margaret; and partly by his oaths, which first possess’d them, partly by the dark night, which did deceive them, but chiefly by my villainy, which did confirm any slander that Don John had made, away went Claudio enrag’d; swore he would meet her as he was appointed next morning at the temple, and there, before the whole congregation, shame her with what he saw o’ernight, and send her home again without a husband.</li>

  <li data-n="1">What would you with me, honest neighbor?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="DOG.">
  <li data-n="2">Marry, sir, I would have some confidence with you that decerns you nearly.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="LEON.">
  <li data-n="3">Brief, I pray you, for you see it is a busy time with me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="DOG.">
  <li data-n="4">Marry, this it is, sir.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="VERG.">
  <li data-n="5">Yes, in truth it is, sir.</li>

<ol data-s="LEON.">
  <li data-n="6">What is it, my good friends?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="DOG.">
  <li data-n="7">Goodman Verges, sir, speaks a little off the matter; an old man, sir, and his wits are not so blunt as, God help, I would desire they were, but in faith, honest as the skin between his brows.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="VERG.">
  <li data-n="8">Yes, I thank God I am as honest as any man living, that is an old man, and no honester than I.</li>

<ol data-s="LEON.">
  <li data-n="10">Neighbors, you are tedious.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="DOG.">
  <li data-n="11">It pleases your worship to say so, but we are the poor Duke’s officers; but truly, for mine own part, if I were as tedious as a king, I could find in my heart to bestow it all of your worship.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="LEON.">
  <li data-n="12">All thy tediousness on me, ah?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="DOG.">
  <li data-n="13">Yea, and ’twere a thousand pound more than ’tis, for I hear as good exclamation on your worship as of any man in the city, and though I be but a poor man, I am glad to hear it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="VERG.">
  <li data-n="14">And so am I.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="LEON.">
  <li data-n="15">I would fain know what you have to say.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="VERG.">
  <li data-n="16">Marry, sir, our watch tonight, excepting your worship’s presence, ha’ ta’en a couple of as arrant knaves as any in Messina.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="DOG.">
  <li data-n="17">A good old man, sir, he will be talking; as they say, “When the age is in, the wit is out.” God help us, it is a world to see! Well said, i’ faith, neighbor Verges. Well, God’s a good man; and two men ride of a horse, one must ride behind. An honest soul, i’ faith, sir, by my troth he is, as ever broke bread; but God is to be worshipp’d; all men are not alike, alas, good neighbor!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="LEON.">
  <li data-n="18">Indeed, neighbor, he comes too short of you.</li>

  <li data-n="20">I must leave you.</li>

<ol data-s="DOG.">
  <li data-n="21">One word, sir. Our watch, sir, have indeed comprehended two aspicious persons, and we would have them this morning examin’d before your worship.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="LEON.">
  <li data-n="22">Take their examination yourself, and bring it me. I am now in great haste, as it may appear unto you.</li>

  <li data-n="1">Come, Friar Francis, be brief—only to the plain form of marriage, and you shall recount their particular duties afterwards.</li>

  <li data-n="6">I do.</li>

  <li data-n="9">None, my lord.</li>

  <li data-n="10">Know you any, Count?</li>

  <li data-n="14">Stand thee by, friar. Father, by your leave,</li>
  <li data-n="15">Will you with free and unconstrained soul</li>
  <li data-n="16">Give me this maid, your daughter?</li>

<ol data-s="LEON.">
  <li data-n="17">As freely, son, as God did give her me.</li>

<ol data-s="CLAUD.">
  <li data-n="18">And what have I to give you back whose worth</li>
  <li data-n="19">May counterpoise this rich and precious gift?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="D. PEDRO.">
  <li data-n="20">Nothing, unless you render her again.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="CLAUD.">
  <li data-n="21">Sweet Prince, you learn me noble thankfulness.</li>
  <li data-n="22">There, Leonato, take her back again.</li>
  <li data-n="23">Give not this rotten orange to your friend,</li>
  <li data-n="24">She’s but the sign and semblance of her honor.</li>
  <li data-n="25">Behold how like a maid she blushes here!</li>
  <li data-n="26">O, what authority and show of truth</li>
  <li data-n="27">Can cunning sin cover itself withal!</li>
  <li data-n="28">Comes not that blood as modest evidence</li>
  <li data-n="29">To witness simple virtue? Would you not swear,</li>
  <li data-n="30">All you that see her, that she were a maid,</li>
  <li data-n="31">By these exterior shows? But she is none:</li>
  <li data-n="32">She knows the heat of a luxurious bed;</li>
  <li data-n="33">Her blush is guiltiness, not modesty.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="LEON.">
  <li data-n="34">What do you mean, my lord?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="CLAUD.">
  <li data-n="34" data-o="6">Not to be married,</li>
  <li data-n="35">Not to knit my soul to an approved wanton.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="LEON.">
  <li data-n="36">Dear my lord, if you, in your own proof,</li>
  <li data-n="37">Have vanquish’d the resistance of her youth,</li>
  <li data-n="38">And made defeat of her virginity—</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="CLAUD.">
  <li data-n="39">I know what you would say. If I have known her,</li>
  <li data-n="40">You will say, she did embrace me as a husband,</li>
  <li data-n="41">And so extenuate the ’forehand sin.</li>
  <li data-n="42">No, Leonato,</li>
  <li data-n="43">I never tempted her with word too large,</li>
  <li data-n="44">But as a brother to his sister, show’d</li>
  <li data-n="45">Bashful sincerity and comely love.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="HERO.">
  <li data-n="46">And seem’d I ever otherwise to you?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="CLAUD.">
  <li data-n="47">Out on thee seeming! I will write against it:</li>
  <li data-n="48">You seem to me as Dian in her orb,</li>
  <li data-n="49">As chaste as is the bud ere it be blown;</li>
  <li data-n="50">But you are more intemperate in your blood</li>
  <li data-n="51">Than Venus, or those pamp’red animals</li>
  <li data-n="52">That rage in savage sensuality.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="HERO.">
  <li data-n="53">Is my lord well, that he doth speak so wide?</li>

  <li data-n="54">Sweet Prince, why speak not you?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="D. PEDRO.">
  <li data-n="54" data-o="7">What should I speak?</li>
  <li data-n="55">I stand dishonor’d, that have gone about</li>
  <li data-n="56">To link my dear friend to a common stale.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="LEON.">
  <li data-n="57">Are these things spoken, or do I but dream?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="D. JOHN.">
  <li data-n="58">Sir, they are spoken, and these things are true.</li>

  <li data-n="63">All this is so, but what of this, my lord?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="CLAUD.">
  <li data-n="64">Let me but move one question to your daughter,</li>
  <li data-n="65">And by that fatherly and kindly power</li>
  <li data-n="66">That you have in her, bid her answer truly.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="LEON.">
  <li data-n="67">I charge thee do so, as thou art my child.</li>
</ol>

  <li data-n="68">O God defend me, how am I beset!</li>
  <li data-n="69">What kind of catechizing call you this?</li>

  <li data-n="74">What man was he talk’d with you yesternight</li>
  <li data-n="75">Out at your window betwixt twelve and one?</li>
  <li data-n="76">Now if you are a maid, answer to this.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="HERO.">
  <li data-n="77">I talk’d with no man at that hour, my lord.</li>

  <li data-n="79">I am sorry you must hear. Upon mine honor,</li>
  <li data-n="80">Myself, my brother, and this grieved count</li>
  <li data-n="81">Did see her, hear her, at that hour last night</li>
  <li data-n="82">Talk with a ruffian at her chamber-window,</li>
  <li data-n="83">Who hath indeed, most like a liberal villain,</li>
  <li data-n="84">Confess’d the vile encounters they have had</li>
  <li data-n="85">A thousand times in secret.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="D. JOHN.">
  <li data-n="86">Fie, fie, they are not to be named, my lord,</li>
  <li data-n="87">Not to be spoke of;</li>
  <li data-n="88">There is not chastity enough in language</li>
  <li data-n="89">Without offense to utter them. Thus, pretty lady,</li>
  <li data-n="90">I am sorry for thy much misgovernment.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="CLAUD.">
  <li data-n="91">O Hero! What a Hero hadst thou been,</li>
  <li data-n="92">If half thy outward graces had been placed</li>
  <li data-n="93">About thy thoughts and counsels of thy heart!</li>
  <li data-n="94">But fare thee well, most foul, most fair! Farewell,</li>
  <li data-n="95">Thou pure impiety and impious purity!</li>
  <li data-n="96">For thee I’ll lock up all the gates of love,</li>
  <li data-n="97">And on my eyelids shall conjecture hang,</li>

  <li data-n="204">But on this travail look for greater birth:</li>
  <li data-n="205">She dying, as it must be so maintain’d,</li>
  <li data-n="206">Upon the instant that she was accus’d,</li>
  <li data-n="207">Shall be lamented, pitied, and excus’d</li>
  <li data-n="208">Of every hearer; for it so falls out</li>

  <li data-n="215">Th’ idea of her life shall sweetly creep</li>

  <li data-n="219">More moving, delicate, and full of life,</li>
  <li data-n="220">Into the eye and prospect of his soul,</li>
  <li data-n="221">Than when she liv’d indeed. Then shall he mourn,</li>
  <li data-n="222">If ever love had interest in his liver,</li>
  <li data-n="223">And wish he had not so accused her;</li>
  <li data-n="224">No, though he thought his accusation true.</li>

  <li data-n="228">But if all aim but this be levell’d false,</li>
  <li data-n="229">The supposition of the lady’s death</li>
  <li data-n="230">Will quench the wonder of her infamy.</li>
  <li data-n="231">And if it sort not well, you may conceal her,</li>
  <li data-n="232">As best befits her wounded reputation,</li>

  <li data-n="135">I’ll tell thee how Beatrice prais’d thy wit the other day. 
I said thou hadst a fine wit.
 “True,” said she, “a fine little one.” “No,” said I, “a great wit.” “Right,” says she,
 “a great gross one.” “Nay,” said I, “a good wit.” “Just,” said she, “it hurts nobody.”
 “Nay,” said I, “the gentleman is wise.” “Certain,” said she, “a wise gentleman.” “Nay,” 
said I, “he hath the tongues.” “That I believe,” said she, “for he swore a thing to me on Monday night, which he forswore on Tuesday morning. 
There’s a double tongue, there’s two tongues.” 
Thus did she an hour together trans-shape thy particular virtues, yet at last she concluded with a sigh, thou wast the proper’st man in Italy.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="CLAUD.">
  <li data-n="136">For the which she wept heartily and said she car’d not.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="D. PEDRO.">
  <li data-n="137">Yea, that she did, but yet for all that, and if she did not hate him deadly, she would love him dearly. The old man’s daughter told us all.</li>

  <li data-n="138">All, all, and, moreover, God saw him when he was hid in the garden.</li>

  <li data-n="140">Yea, and text underneath, “Here dwells Benedick the married man”?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="BENE.">
  <li data-n="141">Fare you well, boy, you know my mind. I will leave you now to your gossip-like humor. You break jests as braggarts do their blades, which, God be thank’d, hurt not. My lord, for your many courtesies I thank you. I must discontinue your company. Your brother the bastard is fled from Messina. You have among you kill’d a sweet and innocent lady. For my Lord Lack-beard there, he and I shall meet, and till then peace be with him.</li>

Marry, I cannot show it in rhyme; I have tried. I can find out no rhyme to “lady” but “baby,” an innocent rhyme; for “scorn,” “horn,” a hard rhyme; for “school,” “fool,” a babbling rhyme: very ominous endings. No, I was not born under a rhyming planet, nor I cannot woo in festival terms.</li>
