<ol data-s="MAR.">
  <li data-n="23">Horatio says ’tis but our fantasy,</li>

  <li data-n="25">Touching this dreaded sight twice seen of us;</li>
  <li data-n="26">Therefore I have entreated him along,</li>
  <li data-n="27">With us to watch the minutes of this night,</li>
  <li data-n="28">That if again this apparition come,</li>
  <li data-n="29">He may approve our eyes and speak to it.</li>

<ol data-s="HOR.">
  <li data-n="60">As thou art to thyself.</li>
  <li data-n="61">Such was the very armor he had on</li>
  <li data-n="62">When he the ambitious Norway combated.</li>
  <li data-n="63">So frown’d he once when in an angry parle</li>
  <li data-n="64">He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.</li>
  <li data-n="65">’Tis strange.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="MAR.">
  <li data-n="66">Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,</li>

<ol data-s="HOR.">
  <li data-n="68">In what particular thought to work I know not,</li>

  <li data-n="70">This bodes some strange eruption to our state.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="MAR.">
  <li data-n="71">Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,</li>
  <li data-n="72">Why this same strict and most observant watch</li>
  <li data-n="73">So nightly toils the subject of the land,</li>
  <li data-n="74">And why such daily cast of brazen cannon,</li>
  <li data-n="75">And foreign mart for implements of war,</li>
  <li data-n="76">Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task</li>
  <li data-n="77">Does not divide the Sunday from the week,</li>
  <li data-n="78">What might be toward, that this sweaty haste</li>
  <li data-n="79">Doth make the night joint-laborer with the day:</li>
  <li data-n="80">Who is’t that can inform me?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="HOR.">
  <li data-n="80" data-o="6">That can I,</li>
  <li data-n="81">At least the whisper goes so: our last king,</li>
  <li data-n="82">Whose image even but now appear’d to us,</li>
  <li data-n="83">Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,</li>
  <li data-n="84">Thereto prick’d on by a most emulate pride,</li>
  <li data-n="85">Dar’d to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet</li>
  <li data-n="86">(For so this side of our known world esteem’d him)</li>
  <li data-n="87">Did slay this Fortinbras, who, by a seal’d compact</li>
  <li data-n="88">Well ratified by law and heraldy,</li>
  <li data-n="89">Did forfeit (with his life) all those his lands</li>
  <li data-n="90">Which he stood seiz’d of, to the conqueror;</li>
  <li data-n="91">Against the which a moi’ty competent</li>
  <li data-n="92">Was gaged by our king, which had return’d</li>
  <li data-n="93">To the inheritance of Fortinbras,</li>
  <li data-n="94">Had he been vanquisher; as by the same comart</li>
  <li data-n="95">And carriage of the article design’d,</li>
  <li data-n="96">His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,</li>
  <li data-n="97">Of unimproved mettle hot and full,</li>
  <li data-n="98">Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there</li>
  <li data-n="99">Shark’d up a list of lawless resolutes</li>
  <li data-n="100">For food and diet to some enterprise</li>
  <li data-n="101">That hath a stomach in’t, which is no other,</li>
  <li data-n="102">As it doth well appear unto our state,</li>
  <li data-n="103">But to recover of us, by strong hand</li>
  <li data-n="104">And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands</li>
  <li data-n="105">So by his father lost; and this, I take it,</li>
  <li data-n="106">Is the main motive of our preparations,</li>
  <li data-n="107">The source of this our watch, and the chief head</li>
  <li data-n="108">Of this post-haste and romage in the land.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="BAR.">
  <li data-n="109">I think it be no other but e’en so.</li>
  <li data-n="110">Well may it sort that this portentous figure</li>
  <li data-n="111">Comes armed through our watch so like the King</li>
  <li data-n="112">That was and is the question of these wars.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="HOR.">
  <li data-n="113">A mote it is to trouble the mind’s eye.</li>
  <li data-n="114">In the most high and palmy state of Rome,</li>
  <li data-n="115">A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,</li>
  <li data-n="116">The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead</li>
  <li data-n="117">Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets.</li>
  <li data-n="118">As stars with trains of fire, and dews of blood,</li>
  <li data-n="119">Disasters in the sun; and the moist star</li>
  <li data-n="120">Upon whose influence Neptune’s empire stands</li>
  <li data-n="121">Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse.</li>
  <li data-n="122">And even the like precurse of fear’d events,</li>
  <li data-n="123">As harbingers preceding still the fates</li>
  <li data-n="124">And prologue to the omen coming on,</li>
  <li data-n="125">Have heaven and earth together demonstrated</li>
  <li data-n="126">Unto our climatures and countrymen.</li>

  <li data-n="132">That may to thee do ease, and grace to me,</li>

  <li data-n="145">We do it wrong, being so majestical,</li>

<ol data-s="HOR.">
  <li data-n="150">And then it started like a guilty thing</li>
  <li data-n="151">Upon a fearful summons. I have heard</li>
  <li data-n="152">The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,</li>
  <li data-n="153">Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat</li>
  <li data-n="154">Awake the god of day, and at his warning,</li>
  <li data-n="155">Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,</li>
  <li data-n="156">Th’ extravagant and erring spirit hies</li>
  <li data-n="157">To his confine; and of the truth herein</li>
  <li data-n="158">This present object made probation.</li>

<ol data-s="MAR.">
  <li data-n="159">It faded on the crowing of the cock.</li>

  <li data-n="161">Wherein our Saviour’s birth is celebrated,</li>
  <li data-n="162">This bird of dawning singeth all night long,</li>
  <li data-n="163">And then they say no spirit dare stir abroad,</li>
  <li data-n="164">The nights are wholesome, then no planets strike,</li>
  <li data-n="165">No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,</li>
  <li data-n="166">So hallowed, and so gracious, is that time.</li>

  <li data-n="169">Walks o’er the dew of yon high eastward hill.</li>
  <li data-n="170">Break we our watch up, and by my advice</li>
  <li data-n="171">Let us impart what we have seen tonight</li>
  <li data-n="172">Unto young Hamlet, for, upon my life,</li>
  <li data-n="173">This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.</li>
  <li data-n="174">Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,</li>

<ol data-s="KING.">
  <li data-n="87">’Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,</li>
  <li data-n="88">To give these mourning duties to your father.</li>
  <li data-n="89">But you must know your father lost a father,</li>
  <li data-n="90">That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound</li>
  <li data-n="91">In filial obligation for some term</li>
  <li data-n="92">To do obsequious sorrow. But to persever</li>
  <li data-n="93">In obstinate condolement is a course</li>
  <li data-n="94">Of impious stubbornness, ’tis unmanly grief,</li>
  <li data-n="95">It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,</li>
  <li data-n="96">A heart unfortified, or mind impatient,</li>
  <li data-n="97">An understanding simple and unschool’d:</li>
  <li data-n="98">For what we know must be, and is as common</li>
  <li data-n="99">As any the most vulgar thing to sense,</li>
  <li data-n="100">Why should we in our peevish opposition</li>
  <li data-n="101">Take it to heart? Fie, ’tis a fault to heaven,</li>
  <li data-n="102">A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,</li>
  <li data-n="103">To reason most absurd, whose common theme</li>
  <li data-n="104">Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,</li>
  <li data-n="105">From the first corse till he that died today,</li>
  <li data-n="106">“This must be so.” We pray you throw to earth</li>
  <li data-n="107">This unprevailing woe, and think of us</li>
  <li data-n="108">As of a father, for let the world take note</li>
  <li data-n="109">You are the most immediate to our throne,</li>
  <li data-n="110">And with no less nobility of love</li>
  <li data-n="111">Than that which dearest father bears his son</li>
  <li data-n="112">Do I impart toward you. For your intent</li>
  <li data-n="113">In going back to school in Wittenberg,</li>
  <li data-n="114">It is most retrograde to our desire,</li>
  <li data-n="115">And we beseech you bend you to remain</li>

  <li data-n="59">My blessing with thee!</li>
  <li data-n="60">And these few precepts in thy memory</li>
  <li data-n="61">Look thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,</li>
  <li data-n="62">Nor any unproportion’d thought his act.</li>
  <li data-n="63">Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar:</li>
  <li data-n="64">Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,</li>
  <li data-n="65">Grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel,</li>
  <li data-n="66">But do not dull thy palm with entertainment</li>
  <li data-n="67">Of each new-hatch’d, unfledg’d courage. Beware</li>
  <li data-n="68">Of entrance to a quarrel, but being in,</li>
  <li data-n="69">Bear’t that th’ opposed may beware of thee.</li>
  <li data-n="70">Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice,</li>
  <li data-n="71">Take each man’s censure, but reserve thy judgment.</li>
  <li data-n="72">Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,</li>
  <li data-n="73">But not express’d in fancy, rich, not gaudy,</li>
  <li data-n="74">For the apparel oft proclaims the man,</li>
  <li data-n="75">And they in France of the best rank and station</li>
  <li data-n="76">Are of a most select and generous chief in that.</li>
  <li data-n="77">Neither a borrower nor a lender be,</li>
  <li data-n="78">For loan oft loses both itself and friend,</li>
  <li data-n="79">And borrowing dulleth th’ edge of husbandry.</li>
  <li data-n="80">This above all: to thine own self be true,</li>
  <li data-n="81">And it must follow, as the night the day,</li>
  <li data-n="82">Thou canst not then be false to any man.</li>
  <li data-n="83">Farewell, my blessing season this in thee!</li>

  <li data-n="96">If it be so—as so ’tis put on me,</li>
  <li data-n="97">And that in way of caution—I must tell you,</li>

  <li data-n="100">What is between you? Give me up the truth.</li>

<ol data-s="OPH.">
  <li data-n="101">He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders</li>

  <li data-n="118">When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul</li>

  <li data-n="122">You must not take for fire. From this time</li>
  <li data-n="123">Be something scanter of your maiden presence,</li>
  <li data-n="124">Set your entreatments at a higher rate</li>

  <li data-n="126">Believe so much in him, that he is young,</li>

  <li data-n="128">Than may be given you. In few, Ophelia,</li>
  <li data-n="129">Do not believe his vows, for they are brokers,</li>
  <li data-n="130">Not of that dye which their investments show,</li>
  <li data-n="131">But mere implorators of unholy suits,</li>

  <li data-n="64">The leperous distillment, whose effect</li>

  <li data-n="66">That swift as quicksilver it courses through</li>

  <li data-n="68">And with a sudden vigor it doth posset</li>
  <li data-n="69">And curd, like eager droppings into milk,</li>

  <li data-n="71">And a most instant tetter bark’d about,</li>
  <li data-n="72">Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust</li>
  <li data-n="73">All my smooth body.</li>
  <li data-n="74">Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother’s hand</li>
  <li data-n="75">Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch’d,</li>
  <li data-n="76">Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,</li>
  <li data-n="77">Unhous’led, disappointed, unanel’d,</li>

  <li data-n="6">Marry, well said, very well said. Look you, sir,</li>
  <li data-n="7">Inquire me first what Danskers are in Paris,</li>
  <li data-n="8">And how, and who, what means, and where they keep,</li>
  <li data-n="9">What company, at what expense; and finding</li>
  <li data-n="10">By this encompassment and drift of question</li>
  <li data-n="11">That they do know my son, come you more nearer</li>
  <li data-n="12">Than your particular demands will touch it.</li>

<ol data-s="POL.">
  <li data-n="17">“And in part him—but,” you may say, “not well.</li>

  <li data-n="20">What forgeries you please: marry, none so rank</li>
  <li data-n="21">As may dishonor him, take heed of that,</li>
  <li data-n="22">But, sir, such wanton, wild, and usual slips</li>
  <li data-n="23">As are companions noted and most known</li>
  <li data-n="24">To youth and liberty.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="REY.">
  <li data-n="24" data-o="4">As gaming, my lord.</li>

  <li data-n="28">Faith, as you may season it in the charge:</li>

  <li data-n="31">That’s not my meaning. But breathe his faults so quaintly</li>
  <li data-n="32">That they may seem the taints of liberty,</li>

  <li data-n="48" data-o="4">Very good, my lord.</li>

  <li data-n="49">And then, sir, does ’a this—’a does—what was I</li>
  <li data-n="50">About to say?</li>
  <li data-n="51">By the mass, I was about to say something.</li>
  <li data-n="52">Where did I leave?</li>

  <li data-n="56">Or then, or then, with such or such, and as you say,</li>
  <li data-n="57">There was ’a gaming, there o’ertook in ’s rouse,</li>

  <li data-n="78">No hat upon his head, his stockins fouled,</li>
  <li data-n="79">Ungart’red, and down-gyved to his ankle,</li>

  <li data-n="81">And with a look so piteous in purport</li>
  <li data-n="82">As if he had been loosed out of hell</li>

  <li data-n="85" data-o="4">What said he?</li>

<ol data-s="OPH.">
  <li data-n="86">He took me by the wrist, and held me hard,</li>
  <li data-n="87">Then goes he to the length of all his arm,</li>
  <li data-n="88">And with his other hand thus o’er his brow,</li>
  <li data-n="89">He falls to such perusal of my face</li>
  <li data-n="90">As ’a would draw it. Long stay’d he so.</li>
  <li data-n="91">At last, a little shaking of mine arm,</li>
  <li data-n="92">And thrice his head thus waving up and down,</li>
  <li data-n="93">He rais’d a sigh so piteous and profound</li>
  <li data-n="94">As it did seem to shatter all his bulk</li>
  <li data-n="95">And end his being. That done, he lets me go,</li>
  <li data-n="96">And with his head over his shoulder turn’d,</li>
  <li data-n="97">He seem’d to find his way without his eyes,</li>
  <li data-n="98">For out a’ doors he went without their helps,</li>
  <li data-n="99">And to the last bended their light on me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="POL.">
  <li data-n="100">Come, go with me. I will go seek the king.</li>
  <li data-n="101">This is the very ecstasy of love,</li>

  <li data-n="103">And leads the will to desperate undertakings</li>
  <li data-n="104">As oft as any passions under heaven</li>
  <li data-n="105">That does afflict our natures. I am sorry—</li>
  <li data-n="106">What, have you given him any hard words of late?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="OPH.">
  <li data-n="107">No, my good lord, but as you did command</li>
  <li data-n="108">I did repel his letters, and denied</li>
  <li data-n="109">His access to me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="POL.">
  <li data-n="109" data-o="4">That hath made him mad.</li>

  <li data-n="111">I had not coted him. I fear’d he did but trifle</li>
  <li data-n="112">And meant to wrack thee, but beshrew my jealousy!</li>
  <li data-n="113">By heaven, it is as proper to our age</li>
  <li data-n="114">To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions,</li>
  <li data-n="115">As it is common for the younger sort</li>
  <li data-n="116">To lack discretion. Come, go we to the king.</li>
  <li data-n="117">This must be known, which, being kept close, might move</li>
  <li data-n="118">More grief to hide, than hate to utter love.</li>

  <li data-n="2">Moreover that we much did long to see you,</li>
  <li data-n="3">The need we have to use you did provoke</li>

  <li data-n="10">I cannot dream of. I entreat you both</li>

  <li data-n="13">That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court</li>
  <li data-n="14">Some little time, so by your companies</li>
  <li data-n="15">To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather</li>
  <li data-n="16">So much as from occasion you may glean,</li>
  <li data-n="17">Whether aught to us unknown afflicts him thus,</li>

What a piece of work is a man, how noble in reason, how infinite in faculties, in form and moving, how express and admirable in action, how like an angel in apprehension, how like a god!

Why, thy face is valanc’d since I saw thee last; com’st thou to beard me in Denmark? What, my young lady and mistress! By’ lady, your ladyship is nearer to heaven than when I saw you last, by the altitude of a chopine. Pray God your voice, like a piece of uncurrent gold, be not crack’d within the ring. Masters, you are all welcome. We’ll e’en to’t like French falc’ners—fly at any thing we see; we’ll have a speech straight. Come give us a taste of your quality, come, a passionate speech.</li>

<ol data-s="1. PLAY.">
  <li data-n="280">What speech, my good lord?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="HAM.">
  <li data-n="281">I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was never acted, or if it was, not above once; for the play, I remember, pleas’d not the million, ’twas caviary to the general, but it was—as I receiv’d it, and others, whose judgments in such matters cried in the top of mine—an excellent play, well digested in the scenes, set down with as much modesty as cunning. I remember one said there were no sallets in the lines to make the matter savory, nor no matter in the phrase that might indict the author of affection, but call’d it an honest method, as wholesome as sweet, and by very much more handsome than fine. One speech in’t I chiefly lov’d, ’twas Aeneas’ tale to Dido, and thereabout of it especially when he speaks of Priam’s slaughter. If it live in your memory, begin at this line—let me see, let me see:</li>
  <li data-n="282">“The rugged Pyrrhus, like th’ Hyrcanian beast—”</li>
  <li data-n="283">’Tis not so, it begins with Pyrrhus:</li>
  <li data-n="284">“The rugged 
Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,</li>
  <li data-n="285">Black as his purpose, did the night resemble</li>
  <li data-n="286">When he lay couched in th’ ominous horse,</li>
  <li data-n="287">Hath now this dread and black complexion smear’d</li>
  <li data-n="288">With heraldry more dismal: head to foot</li>
  <li data-n="289">Now is he total gules, horridly trick’d</li>
  <li data-n="290">With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,</li>
  <li data-n="291">Bak’d and impasted with the parching streets,</li>
  <li data-n="292">That lend a tyrannous and a damned light</li>
  <li data-n="293">To their lord’s murder. Roasted in wrath and fire,</li>
  <li data-n="294">And thus o’er-sized with coagulate gore,</li>
  <li data-n="295">With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus</li>
  <li data-n="296">Old grandsire Priam seeks.”</li>

  <li data-n="304">But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword</li>
  <li data-n="305">Th’ unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,</li>
  <li data-n="306">Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top</li>
  <li data-n="307">Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash</li>
  <li data-n="308">Takes prisoner Pyrrhus’ ear; for lo his sword,</li>
  <li data-n="309">Which was declining on the milky head</li>
  <li data-n="310">Of reverent Priam, seem’d i’ th’ air to stick.</li>

  <li data-n="319">A roused vengeance sets him new a-work,</li>
  <li data-n="320">And never did the Cyclops’ hammers fall</li>
  <li data-n="321">On Mars’s armor forg’d for proof eterne</li>
  <li data-n="322">With less remorse than Pyrrhus’ bleeding sword</li>
  <li data-n="323">Now falls on Priam.</li>
  <li data-n="324">Out, out, thou strumpet Fortune! All you gods,</li>
  <li data-n="325">In general synod take away her power!</li>
  <li data-n="326">Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,</li>

  <li data-n="399">A stallion. Fie upon’t, foh!</li>
  <li data-n="400">About, my brains! Hum—I have heard</li>
  <li data-n="401">That guilty creatures sitting at a play</li>
  <li data-n="402">Have by the very cunning of the scene</li>
  <li data-n="403">Been struck so to the soul, that presently</li>
  <li data-n="404">They have proclaim’d their malefactions:</li>
  <li data-n="405">For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak</li>
  <li data-n="406">With most miraculous organ. I’ll have these players</li>
  <li data-n="407">Play something like the murder of my father</li>
  <li data-n="408">Before mine uncle. I’ll observe his looks,</li>
  <li data-n="409">I’ll tent him to the quick. If ’a do blench,</li>
  <li data-n="410">I know my course. The spirit that I have seen</li>
  <li data-n="411">May be a dev’l, and the dev’l hath power</li>
  <li data-n="412">T’ assume a pleasing shape, yea, and perhaps,</li>
  <li data-n="413">Out of my weakness and my melancholy,</li>
  <li data-n="414">As he is very potent with such spirits,</li>
  <li data-n="415">Abuses me to damn me. I’ll have grounds</li>
  <li data-n="416">More relative than this—the play’s the thing</li>
  <li data-n="417">Wherein I’ll catch the conscience of the king.</li>

<ol data-s="HAM.">
  <li data-n="56">To be, or not to be, that is the question:</li>
  <li data-n="57">Whether ’tis nobler in the mind to suffer</li>
  <li data-n="58">The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,</li>
  <li data-n="59">Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,</li>
  <li data-n="60">And by opposing, end them. To die, to sleep—</li>
  <li data-n="61">No more, and by a sleep to say we end</li>
  <li data-n="62">The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks</li>
  <li data-n="63">That flesh is heir to; ’tis a consummation</li>
  <li data-n="64">Devoutly to be wish’d. To die, to sleep—</li>
  <li data-n="65">To sleep, perchance to dream—ay, there’s the rub,</li>
  <li data-n="66">For in that sleep of death what dreams may come,</li>
  <li data-n="67">When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,</li>
  <li data-n="68">Must give us pause; there’s the respect</li>
  <li data-n="69">That makes calamity of so long life:</li>
  <li data-n="70">For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,</li>
  <li data-n="71">Th’ oppressor’s wrong, the proud man’s contumely,</li>
  <li data-n="72">The pangs of despis’d love, the law’s delay,</li>
  <li data-n="73">The insolence of office, and the spurns</li>
  <li data-n="74">That patient merit of th’ unworthy takes,</li>
  <li data-n="75">When he himself might his quietus make</li>
  <li data-n="76">With a bare bodkin; who would fardels bear,</li>
  <li data-n="77">To grunt and sweat under a weary life,</li>
  <li data-n="78">But that the dread of something after death,</li>
  <li data-n="79">The undiscover’d country, from whose bourn</li>
  <li data-n="80">No traveler returns, puzzles the will,</li>
  <li data-n="81">And makes us rather bear those ills we have,</li>
  <li data-n="82">Than fly to others that we know not of?</li>
  <li data-n="83">Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,</li>
  <li data-n="84">And thus the native hue of resolution</li>
  <li data-n="85">Is sicklied o’er with the pale cast of thought,</li>
  <li data-n="86">And enterprises of great pitch and moment</li>
  <li data-n="87">With this regard their currents turn awry,</li>
  <li data-n="88">And lose the name of action.—Soft you now,</li>

  <li data-n="101">Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.</li>
  <li data-n="102">There, my lord.</li>

  <li data-n="108">Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than with honesty?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="HAM.">
  <li data-n="109">Ay, truly, for the power of beauty will sooner transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can translate beauty into his likeness. This was sometime a paradox, but now the time gives it proof. I did love you once.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="OPH.">
  <li data-n="110">Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="HAM.">
  <li data-n="111">You should not have believ’d me, for virtue cannot so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it. I lov’d you not.</li>

  <li data-n="112">I was the more deceiv’d.</li>

<ol data-s="HAM.">
  <li data-n="113">Get thee to a nunn’ry, why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners? I am myself indifferent honest, but yet I could accuse me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne me: I am very proud, revengeful, ambitious, with more offenses at my beck than I have thoughts to put them in, imagination to give them shape, or time to act them in. What should such fellows as I do crawling between earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves, believe none of us. Go thy ways to a nunn’ry. Where’s your father?</li>

<ol data-s="OPH.">
  <li data-n="116">O, help him, you sweet heavens!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="HAM.">
  <li data-n="117">If thou dost marry, I’ll give thee this plague for thy dowry: be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not escape calumny. Get thee to a nunn’ry, farewell. Or if thou wilt needs marry, marry a fool, for wise men know well enough what monsters you make of them. To a nunn’ry, go, and quickly too. Farewell.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="OPH.">
  <li data-n="118">Heavenly powers, restore him!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="HAM.">
  <li data-n="119">I have heard of your paintings, well enough. God hath given you one face, and you make yourselves another. You jig and amble, and you lisp, you nickname God’s creatures and make your wantonness your ignorance. Go to, I’ll no more on’t, it hath made me mad. I say we will have no more marriage.

<h3>Scene 2</h3>

<h4 class="direction-location">Elsinore. A hall in Elsinore castle.</h4>

<div class="direction-location">
	Enter Hamlet and three of the Players.
	
		HAM.	
		1. PLAY.
		P. QUEEN.
		P. PRO.
		P. LUC.
	
</div>

<ol data-s="HAM.">
  <li data-n="1">Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounc’d it to you,trippingly on the tongue, but if you mouth it, as many of our players do, I had as lief the town-crier spoke my lines. Nor do not saw the air too much with your hand, thus, but use all gently, for in the very torrent, tempest, and, as I may say, whirlwind of your passion, you must acquire and beget a temperance that may give it smoothness. O, it offends me to the soul to hear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear apassion to totters, to very rags, to spleet the ears of the groundlings, who for the most part are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb shows and noise. I would have such a fellow whipt for o’erdoing Termagant, it out-Herods Herod, pray you avoid it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="1. PLAY.">
  <li data-n="2">I warrant your honor.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="HAM.">
  <li data-n="3">Be not too tame neither, but let your own discretion be your tutor. Suit the action to the word, the word to the action, with this special observance, that you o’erstep not the modesty of nature: for any thing so o’erdone is from the purpose of playing, whose end, both at the first and now, was and is, to hold as ’twere the mirror up to nature: to show virtue her feature, scorn her own image, and the very age and body of the time his form and pressure. Now this overdone, or come tardy off, though it makes the unskillful laugh, cannot but make the judicious grieve; the censure of which one must in your allowance o’erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be players that I have seen play—and heard others praise, and that highly—not to speak it profanely, that, neither having th’ accent of Christians nor the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have so strutted and bellow’d that I have thought some of Nature’s journeymen had made men, and not made them well, they imitated humanity so abominably.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="1. PLAY.">
  <li data-n="4">I hope we have reform’d that indifferently with us, sir.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="HAM.">
  <li data-n="5">O, reform it altogether. And let those that play your clowns speak no more than is set down for them, for there be of them that will themselves laugh to set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh too, though in the mean time some necessary question of the play be then to be consider’d. That’s villainous, and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it. Go make you ready.</li>

	Dumb show follows. Enter a King and a Queen very lovingly, the Queen embracing him and he her. She kneels and makes show of protestation unto him. He takes her up and declines his head upon her neck. He lies him down upon a bank of flowers. She, seeing him asleep, leaves him. Anon come in another man, takes off his crown, kisses it, pours poison in the sleeper’s ears, and leaves him. The Queen returns, finds the King dead, makes passionate action. The pois’ner with some three or four mutes come in again, seem to condole with her. The dead body is carried away. The pois’ner woos the Queen with gifts; she seems harsh and unwilling awhile, but in the end accepts love.

  <li data-n="93">Nay, good my lord, for my ease, in good faith.

  <li data-n="111">The King, sir, hath wager’d with him six Barbary horses, against the which he has impawn’d, as I take it, six French rapiers and poniards, with their assigns, as girdle, hangers, and so.

  <li data-n="116">The King, sir, hath laid, sir, that in a dozen passes between yourself and him, he shall not exceed you three hits; he hath laid on twelve for nine; and it would come to immediate trial, if your lordship would vouchsafe the answer.</li>
