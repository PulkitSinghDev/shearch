  <li data-n="7">The Dukes of Orléans, Calaber, Bretagne, and Alanson,</li>
  <li data-n="8">Seven earls, twelve barons, and twenty reverend bishops,</li>

  <li data-n="13">To your most gracious hands, that are the substance</li>
  <li data-n="14">Of that great shadow I did represent:</li>

  <li data-n="17">Suffolk, arise. Welcome, Queen Margaret,</li>
  <li data-n="18">I can express no kinder sign of love</li>

  <li data-n="20">Lend me a heart replete with thankfulness!</li>
  <li data-n="21">For thou hast given me in this beauteous face</li>
  <li data-n="22">A world of earthly blessings to my soul,</li>

  <li data-n="27">In courtly company, or at my beads,</li>
  <li data-n="28">With you, mine alder-liefest sovereign,</li>
  <li data-n="29">Makes me the bolder to salute my king</li>
  <li data-n="30">With ruder terms, such as my wit affords</li>
  <li data-n="31">And overjoy of heart doth minister.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="KING.">
  <li data-n="32">Her sight did ravish, but her grace in speech,</li>

  <li data-n="61">Brave peers of England, pillars of the state,</li>
  <li data-n="62">To you Duke Humphrey must unload his grief,</li>
  <li data-n="63">Your grief, the common grief of all the land.</li>
  <li data-n="64">What? Did my brother Henry spend his youth,</li>
  <li data-n="65">His valor, coin, and people, in the wars?</li>
  <li data-n="66">Did he so often lodge in open field,</li>
  <li data-n="67">In winter’s cold and summer’s parching heat,</li>
  <li data-n="68">To conquer France, his true inheritance?</li>
  <li data-n="69">And did my brother Bedford toil his wits,</li>
  <li data-n="70">To keep by policy what Henry got?</li>
  <li data-n="71">Have you yourselves, Somerset, Buckingham,</li>
  <li data-n="72">Brave York, Salisbury, and victorious Warwick,</li>
  <li data-n="73">Receiv’d deep scars in France and Normandy?</li>
  <li data-n="74">Or hath mine uncle Beauford and myself,</li>
  <li data-n="75">With all the learned Council of the realm,</li>
  <li data-n="76">Studied so long, sat in the Council-house</li>
  <li data-n="77">Early and late, debating to and fro</li>
  <li data-n="78">How France and Frenchmen might be kept in awe,</li>
  <li data-n="79">And hath his Highness in his infancy</li>
  <li data-n="80">Crowned in Paris in despite of foes?</li>
  <li data-n="81">And shall these labors and these honors die?</li>
  <li data-n="82">Shall Henry’s conquest, Bedford’s vigilance,</li>
  <li data-n="83">Your deeds of war, and all our counsel die?</li>
  <li data-n="84">O peers of England, shameful is this league,</li>
  <li data-n="85">Fatal this marriage, cancelling your fame,</li>
  <li data-n="86">Blotting your names from books of memory,</li>
  <li data-n="87">Rasing the characters of your renown,</li>
  <li data-n="88">Defacing monuments of conquer’d France,</li>
  <li data-n="89">Undoing all, as all had never been!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="CAR.">
  <li data-n="90">Nephew, what means this passionate discourse,</li>
  <li data-n="91">This peroration with such circumstance?</li>
  <li data-n="92">For France, ’tis ours; and we will keep it still.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="GLOU.">
  <li data-n="93">Ay, uncle, we will keep it, if we can;</li>
  <li data-n="94">But now it is impossible we should.</li>
  <li data-n="95">Suffolk, the new-made duke that rules the roast,</li>
  <li data-n="96">Hath given the duchy of Anjou, and Maine,</li>
  <li data-n="97">Unto the poor King Reignier, whose large style</li>
  <li data-n="98">Agrees not with the leanness of his purse.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="SAL.">
  <li data-n="99">Now by the death of Him that died for all,</li>
  <li data-n="100">These counties were the keys of Normandy.</li>
  <li data-n="101">But wherefore weeps Warwick, my valiant son?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="WAR.">
  <li data-n="102">For grief that they are past recovery;</li>

  <li data-n="104">My sword should shed hot blood, mine eyes no tears.</li>
  <li data-n="105">Anjou and Maine? Myself did win them both.</li>
  <li data-n="106">Those provinces these arms of mine did conquer,</li>
  <li data-n="107">And are the cities that I got with wounds</li>
  <li data-n="108">Deliver’d up again with peaceful words?</li>

  <li data-n="110">For Suffolk’s duke, may he be suffocate,</li>
  <li data-n="111">That dims the honor of this warlike isle!</li>
  <li data-n="112">France should have torn and rent my very heart</li>
  <li data-n="113">Before I would have yielded to this league.</li>
  <li data-n="114">I never read but England’s kings have had</li>
  <li data-n="115">Large sums of gold and dowries with their wives,</li>
  <li data-n="116">And our King Henry gives away his own,</li>
  <li data-n="117">To match with her that brings no vantages.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="GLOU.">
  <li data-n="118">A proper jest, and never heard before,</li>

  <li data-n="120">For costs and charges in transporting her!</li>
  <li data-n="121">She should have stay’d in France, and starv’d in France,</li>

  <li data-n="136">And no great friend, I fear me, to the King.</li>
  <li data-n="137">Consider, lords, he is the next of blood,</li>
  <li data-n="138">And heir-apparent to the English crown.</li>
  <li data-n="139">Had Henry got an empire by his marriage,</li>
  <li data-n="140">And all the wealthy kingdoms of the west,</li>
  <li data-n="141">There’s reason he should be displeas’d at it.</li>

  <li data-n="35">But list to me, my Humphrey, my sweet duke:</li>

  <li data-n="37">In the cathedral church of Westminster,</li>
  <li data-n="38">And in that chair where kings and queens were crown’d,</li>
  <li data-n="39">Where Henry and Dame Margaret kneel’d to me,</li>

<ol data-s="YORK.">
  <li data-n="1">Now, my good Lords of Salisbury and Warwick,</li>
  <li data-n="2">Our simple supper ended, give me leave</li>
  <li data-n="3">In this close walk to satisfy myself</li>
  <li data-n="4">In craving your opinion of my title,</li>
  <li data-n="5">Which is infallible, to England’s crown.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="SAL.">
  <li data-n="6">My lord, I long to hear it at full.</li>

<ol data-s="WAR.">
  <li data-n="7">Sweet York, begin; and if thy claim be good,</li>
  <li data-n="8">The Nevils are thy subjects to command.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="YORK.">
  <li data-n="9">Then thus:</li>
  <li data-n="10">Edward the Third, my lords, had seven sons:</li>
  <li data-n="11">The first, Edward the Black Prince, Prince of Wales;</li>
  <li data-n="12">The second, William of Hatfield; and the third,</li>
  <li data-n="13">Lionel Duke of Clarence; next to whom</li>
  <li data-n="14">Was John of Gaunt, the Duke of Lancaster;</li>
  <li data-n="15">The fifth was Edmund Langley, Duke of York;</li>
  <li data-n="16">The sixth was Thomas of Woodstock, Duke of Gloucester;</li>
  <li data-n="17">William of Windsor was the seventh and last.</li>
  <li data-n="18">Edward the Black Prince died before his father,</li>
  <li data-n="19">And left behind him Richard, his only son,</li>
  <li data-n="20">Who after Edward the Third’s death reign’d as king</li>
  <li data-n="21">Till Henry Bullingbrook, Duke of Lancaster,</li>
  <li data-n="22">The eldest son and heir of John of Gaunt,</li>
  <li data-n="23">Crown’d by the name of Henry the Fourth,</li>
  <li data-n="24">Seiz’d on the realm, depos’d the rightful king,</li>
  <li data-n="25">Sent his poor queen to France, from whence she came,</li>
  <li data-n="26">And him to Pomfret; where, as all you know,</li>
  <li data-n="27">Harmless Richard was murdered traitorously.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="WAR.">
  <li data-n="28">Father, the Duke hath told the truth;</li>
  <li data-n="29">Thus got the house of Lancaster the crown.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="YORK.">
  <li data-n="30">Which now they hold by force and not by right;</li>
  <li data-n="31">For Richard, the first son’s heir, being dead,</li>
  <li data-n="32">The issue of the next son should have reign’d.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="SAL.">
  <li data-n="33">But William of Hatfield died without an heir.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="YORK.">
  <li data-n="34">The third son, Duke of Clarence, from whose line</li>
  <li data-n="35">I claim the crown, had issue, Philippe, a daughter,</li>
  <li data-n="36">Who married Edmund Mortimer, Earl of March;</li>
  <li data-n="37">Edmund had issue, Roger Earl of March;</li>
  <li data-n="38">Roger had issue, Edmund, Anne, and Eleanor.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="SAL.">
  <li data-n="39">This Edmund, in the reign of Bullingbrook,</li>
  <li data-n="40">As I have read, laid claim unto the crown,</li>
  <li data-n="41">And but for Owen Glendower, had been king,</li>
  <li data-n="42">Who kept him in captivity till he died.</li>
  <li data-n="43">But, to the rest.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="YORK.">
  <li data-n="44">His eldest sister, Anne,</li>
  <li data-n="45">My mother, being heir unto the crown,</li>
  <li data-n="46">Married Richard Earl of Cambridge, who was</li>
  <li data-n="47">To Edmund Langley, Edward the Third’s fifth son, son.</li>
  <li data-n="48">By her I claim the kingdom. She was heir</li>
  <li data-n="49">To Roger Earl of March, who was the son</li>
  <li data-n="50">Of Edmund Mortimer, who married Philippe,</li>
  <li data-n="51">Sole daughter unto Lionel Duke of Clarence;</li>
  <li data-n="52">So, if the issue of the elder son</li>

  <li data-n="54">What plain proceedings is more plain than this?</li>

  <li data-n="57">Till Lionel’s issue fails, his should not reign.</li>
  <li data-n="58">It fails not yet, but flourishes in thee,</li>
  <li data-n="59">And in thy sons, fair slips of such a stock.</li>
  <li data-n="60">Then, father Salisbury, kneel we together,</li>

  <li data-n="76">’Tis that they seek; and they in seeking that</li>

  <li data-n="100">A heart unspotted is not easily daunted.</li>
  <li data-n="101">The purest spring is not so free from mud</li>
  <li data-n="102">As I am clear from treason to my sovereign.</li>

</ol>

<ol data-s="YORK.">
  <li data-n="104">’Tis thought, my lord, that you took bribes of France,</li>

</ol>

<ol data-s="GLOU.">
  <li data-n="107">Is it but thought so? What are they that think it?</li>
  <li data-n="108">I never robb’d the soldiers of their pay,</li>

  <li data-n="110">So help me God, as I have watch’d the night,</li>

  <li data-n="112">That doit that e’er I wrested from the King,</li>

  <li data-n="115">No; many a pound of mine own proper store,</li>

  <li data-n="118">And never ask’d for restitution.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="CAR.">
  <li data-n="119">It serves you well, my lord, to say so much.</li>

  <li data-n="121">In your protectorship you did devise</li>

</ol>

<ol data-s="GLOU.">
  <li data-n="124">Why, ’tis well known that, whiles I was Protector,</li>
  <li data-n="125">Pity was all the fault that was in me;</li>
  <li data-n="126">For I should melt at an offender’s tears,</li>
  <li data-n="127">And lowly words were ransom for their fault.</li>
  <li data-n="128">Unless it were a bloody murderer,</li>
  <li data-n="129">Or foul felonious thief that fleec’d poor passengers,</li>
  <li data-n="130">I never gave them condign punishment.</li>
  <li data-n="131">Murder indeed, that bloody sin, I tortur’d</li>

<ol data-s="GLOU.">
  <li data-n="142">Ah, gracious lord, these days are dangerous:</li>

  <li data-n="149">And prove the period of their tyranny,</li>
  <li data-n="150">I would expend it with all willingness.</li>
  <li data-n="151">But mine is made the prologue to their play;</li>
  <li data-n="152">For thousands more, that yet suspect no peril,</li>
  <li data-n="153">Will not conclude their plotted tragedy.</li>
  <li data-n="154">Beauford’s red sparkling eyes blab his heart’s malice,</li>

  <li data-n="156">Sharp Buckingham unburdens with his tongue</li>
  <li data-n="157">The envious load that lies upon his heart;</li>
  <li data-n="158">And dogged York, that reaches at the moon,</li>
  <li data-n="159">Whose overweening arm I have pluck’d back,</li>
  <li data-n="160">By false accuse doth level at my life.</li>
  <li data-n="161">And you, my sovereign lady, with the rest,</li>
  <li data-n="162">Causeless have laid disgraces on my head,</li>

  <li data-n="164">My liefest liege to be mine enemy.</li>
  <li data-n="165">Ay, all of you have laid your heads together—</li>
  <li data-n="166">Myself had notice of your conventicles—</li>
  <li data-n="167">And all to make away my guiltless life.</li>
  <li data-n="168">I shall not want false witness to condemn me,</li>
  <li data-n="169">Nor store of treasons to augment my guilt.</li>
  <li data-n="170">The ancient proverb will be well effected:</li>

  <li data-n="82">Was I for this nigh wrack’d upon the sea,</li>

  <li data-n="94">The pretty vaulting sea refus’d to drown me,</li>

  <li data-n="96">With tears as salt as sea, through thy unkindness.</li>
  <li data-n="97">The splitting rocks cow’r’d in the sinking sands,</li>
  <li data-n="98">And would not dash me with their ragged sides,</li>
  <li data-n="99">Because thy flinty heart, more hard than they,</li>
  <li data-n="100">Might in thy palace perish Margaret.</li>
  <li data-n="101">As far as I could ken thy chalky cliffs,</li>
  <li data-n="102">When from thy shore the tempest beat us back,</li>
  <li data-n="103">I stood upon the hatches in the storm;</li>
  <li data-n="104">And when the dusky sky began to rob</li>
  <li data-n="105">My earnest-gaping sight of thy land’s view,</li>
  <li data-n="106">I took a costly jewel from my neck,</li>
  <li data-n="107">A heart it was, bound in with diamonds,</li>
  <li data-n="108">And threw it towards thy land. The sea receiv’d it,</li>
  <li data-n="109">And so I wish’d thy body might my heart.</li>
  <li data-n="110">And even with this I lost fair England’s view,</li>
  <li data-n="111">And bid mine eyes be packing with my heart,</li>
  <li data-n="112">And call’d them blind and dusky spectacles,</li>
  <li data-n="113">For losing ken of Albion’s wished coast.</li>
  <li data-n="114">How often have I tempted Suffolk’s tongue</li>
  <li data-n="115">(The agent of thy foul inconstancy)</li>
  <li data-n="116">To sit and witch me, as Ascanius did</li>
  <li data-n="117">When he to madding Dido would unfold</li>
  <li data-n="118">His father’s acts commenc’d in burning Troy!</li>
  <li data-n="119">Am I not witch’d like her? Or thou not false like him?</li>

  <li data-n="248">They say, by him the good Duke Humphrey died;</li>

  <li data-n="250">And mere instinct of love and loyalty,</li>
  <li data-n="251">Free from a stubborn opposite intent,</li>
  <li data-n="252">As being thought to contradict your liking,</li>

  <li data-n="255">That if your Highness should intend to sleep,</li>
  <li data-n="256">And charge that no man should disturb your rest</li>
  <li data-n="257">In pain of your dislike, or pain of death,</li>

Wherefore, on a brick wall have I climb’d into this garden, to see if I can eat grass, or pick a sallet another while, which is not amiss to cool a man’s stomach this hot weather. And I think this word ’sallet’ was born to do me good; for many a time, but for a sallet, my brain-pan had been cleft with a brown bill; and many a time, when I have been dry and bravely marching, it hath serv’d me instead of a quart pot to drink in; and now the word ‘sallet’ must serve me to feed on.</li>

  <li data-n="12">And like rich hangings in a homely house,</li>
  <li data-n="13">So was his will in his old feeble body.</li>
  <li data-n="14">But noble as he is, look where he comes.</li>

  <li data-n="15">Now, by my sword, well hast thou fought today;</li>
  <li data-n="16">By th’ mass, so did we all. I thank you, Richard.</li>
  <li data-n="17">God knows how long it is I have to live,</li>
  <li data-n="18">And it hath pleas’d him that three times today</li>
  <li data-n="19">You have defended me from imminent death.</li>
  <li data-n="20">Well, lords, we have not got that which we have:</li>
  <li data-n="21">’Tis not enough our foes are this time fled,</li>
  <li data-n="22">Being opposites of such repairing nature.</li>

  <li data-n="23">I know our safety is to follow them,</li>
  <li data-n="24">For, as I hear, the King is fled to London,</li>

  <li data-n="26">Let us pursue him ere the writs go forth.</li>
  <li data-n="27">What says Lord Warwick? Shall we after them?</li>

<ol data-s="WAR.">
  <li data-n="28">After them! Nay, before them, if we can.</li>
  <li data-n="29">Now, by my faith, lords, ’twas a glorious day.</li>
  <li data-n="30">Saint Albans battle won by famous York</li>
  <li data-n="31">Shall be eterniz’d in all age to come.</li>
  <li data-n="32">Sound drum and trumpets, and to London all,</li>
