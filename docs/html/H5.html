<ol data-s="CANT.">
  <li data-n="1">My lord, I’ll tell you, that self bill is urg’d</li>
  <li data-n="2">Which in th’ eleventh year of the last king’s reign</li>
  <li data-n="3">Was like, and had indeed against us pass’d,</li>
  <li data-n="4">But that the scambling and unquiet time</li>
  <li data-n="5">Did push it out of farther question.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ELY.">
  <li data-n="6">But how, my lord, shall we resist it now?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="CANT.">
  <li data-n="7">It must be thought on. If it pass against us,</li>
  <li data-n="8">We lose the better half of our possession;</li>
  <li data-n="9">For all the temporal lands, which men devout</li>
  <li data-n="10">By testament have given to the Church,</li>
  <li data-n="11">Would they strip from us; being valu’d thus:</li>
  <li data-n="12">As much as would maintain, to the King’s honor,</li>
  <li data-n="13">Full fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knights,</li>
  <li data-n="14">Six thousand and two hundred good esquires;</li>
  <li data-n="15">And to relief of lazars, and weak age</li>
  <li data-n="16">Of indigent faint souls past corporal toil,</li>
  <li data-n="17">A hundred almshouses right well supplied;</li>
  <li data-n="18">And to the coffers of the King beside,</li>
  <li data-n="19">A thousand pounds by th’ year. Thus runs the bill.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ELY.">
  <li data-n="20">This would drink deep.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="CANT.">
  <li data-n="20" data-o="4">’Twould drink the cup and all.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ELY.">
  <li data-n="21">But what prevention?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="CANT.">
  <li data-n="22">The King is full of grace and fair regard.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ELY.">
  <li data-n="23">And a true lover of the holy Church.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="CANT.">
  <li data-n="24">The courses of his youth promis’d it not.</li>
  <li data-n="25">The breath no sooner left his father’s body,</li>
  <li data-n="26">But that his wildness, mortified in him,</li>
  <li data-n="27">Seem’d to die too; yea, at that very moment,</li>
  <li data-n="28">Consideration like an angel came</li>
  <li data-n="29">And whipt th’ offending Adam out of him,</li>
  <li data-n="30">Leaving his body as a paradise</li>
  <li data-n="31">T’ envelop and contain celestial spirits.</li>
  <li data-n="32">Never was such a sudden scholar made;</li>
  <li data-n="33">Never came reformation in a flood</li>
  <li data-n="34">With such a heady currance, scouring faults;</li>
  <li data-n="35">Nor never Hydra-headed willfulness</li>
  <li data-n="36">So soon did lose his seat (and all at once)</li>
  <li data-n="37">As in this king.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ELY.">
  <li data-n="37" data-o="3">We are blessed in the change.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="CANT.">
  <li data-n="38">Hear him but reason in divinity,</li>
  <li data-n="39">And all-admiring, with an inward wish</li>
  <li data-n="40">You would desire the King were made a prelate;</li>
  <li data-n="41">Hear him debate of commonwealth affairs,</li>
  <li data-n="42">You would say it hath been all in all his study;</li>
  <li data-n="43">List his discourse of war, and you shall hear</li>
  <li data-n="44">A fearful battle rend’red you in music;</li>
  <li data-n="45">Turn him to any cause of policy,</li>
  <li data-n="46">The Gordian knot of it he will unloose,</li>
  <li data-n="47">Familiar as his garter; that, when he speaks,</li>
  <li data-n="48">The air, a charter’d libertine, is still,</li>
  <li data-n="49">And the mute wonder lurketh in men’s ears</li>
  <li data-n="50">To steal his sweet and honeyed sentences;</li>
  <li data-n="51">So that the art and practic part of life</li>
  <li data-n="52">Must be the mistress to this theoric;</li>
  <li data-n="53">Which is a wonder how his Grace should glean it,</li>
  <li data-n="54">Since his addiction was to courses vain,</li>
  <li data-n="55">His companies unletter’d, rude, and shallow,</li>
  <li data-n="56">His hours fill’d up with riots, banquets, sports;</li>
  <li data-n="57">And never noted in him any study,</li>
  <li data-n="58">Any retirement, any sequestration</li>
  <li data-n="59">From open haunts and popularity.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ELY.">
  <li data-n="60">The strawberry grows underneath the nettle,</li>
  <li data-n="61">And wholesome berries thrive and ripen best</li>
  <li data-n="62">Neighbor’d by fruit of baser quality;</li>
  <li data-n="63">And so the Prince obscur’d his contemplation</li>
  <li data-n="64">Under the veil of wildness, which (no doubt)</li>
  <li data-n="65">Grew like the summer grass, fastest by night,</li>
  <li data-n="66">Unseen, yet crescive in his faculty.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="CANT.">
  <li data-n="67">It must be so; for miracles are ceas’d;</li>
  <li data-n="68">And therefore we must needs admit the means</li>
  <li data-n="69">How things are perfected.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ELY.">
  <li data-n="69" data-o="5">But, my good lord,</li>
  <li data-n="70">How now for mitigation of this bill</li>
  <li data-n="71">Urg’d by the commons? Doth his Majesty</li>
  <li data-n="72">Incline to it, or no?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="CANT.">
  <li data-n="72" data-o="4">He seems indifferent;</li>
  <li data-n="73">Or rather swaying more upon our part</li>
  <li data-n="74">Than cherishing th’ exhibitors against us;</li>
  <li data-n="75">For I have made an offer to his Majesty,</li>
  <li data-n="76">Upon our spiritual convocation</li>
  <li data-n="77">And in regard of causes now in hand,</li>
  <li data-n="78">Which I have open’d to his Grace at large,</li>
  <li data-n="79">As touching France, to give a greater sum</li>
  <li data-n="80">Than ever at one time the clergy yet</li>
  <li data-n="81">Did to his predecessors part withal.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ELY.">
  <li data-n="82">How did this offer seem receiv’d, my lord?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="CANT.">
  <li data-n="83">With good acceptance of his Majesty;</li>
  <li data-n="84">Save that there was not time enough to hear,</li>
  <li data-n="85">As I perceiv’d his Grace would fain have done,</li>
  <li data-n="86">The severals and unhidden passages</li>
  <li data-n="87">Of his true titles to some certain dukedoms,</li>
  <li data-n="88">And generally to the crown and seat of France,</li>
  <li data-n="89">Deriv’d from Edward, his great-grandfather.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ELY.">
  <li data-n="90">What was th’ impediment that broke this off?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="CANT.">
  <li data-n="91">The French ambassador upon that instant</li>
  <li data-n="92">Crav’d audience; and the hour, I think, is come</li>
  <li data-n="93">To give him hearing. Is it four a’ clock?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ELY.">
  <li data-n="94">It is.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="CANT.">
  <li data-n="95">Then go we in, to know his embassy;</li>
  <li data-n="96">Which I could with a ready guess declare,</li>
  <li data-n="97">Before the Frenchman speak a word of it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ELY.">
  <li data-n="98">I’ll wait upon you, and I long to hear it.</li>

</div>

<ol data-s="CANT.">
  <li data-n="7">God and his angels guard your sacred throne,</li>
  <li data-n="8">And make you long become it!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="K. HEN.">
  <li data-n="8" data-o="6">Sure we thank you.</li>
  <li data-n="9">My learned lord, we pray you to proceed,</li>
  <li data-n="10">And justly and religiously unfold</li>
  <li data-n="11">Why the law Salique, that they have in France,</li>
  <li data-n="12">Or should, or should not, bar us in our claim;</li>
  <li data-n="13">And God forbid, my dear and faithful lord,</li>
  <li data-n="14">That you should fashion, wrest, or bow your reading,</li>
  <li data-n="15">Or nicely charge your understanding soul</li>
  <li data-n="16">With opening titles miscreate, whose right</li>
  <li data-n="17">Suits not in native colors with the truth;</li>
  <li data-n="18">For God doth know how many now in health</li>
  <li data-n="19">Shall drop their blood in approbation</li>
  <li data-n="20">Of what your reverence shall incite us to.</li>
  <li data-n="21">Therefore take heed how you impawn our person,</li>
  <li data-n="22">How you awake our sleeping sword of war—</li>
  <li data-n="23">We charge you, in the name of God, take heed;</li>
  <li data-n="24">For never two such kingdoms did contend</li>
  <li data-n="25">Without much fall of blood, whose guiltless drops</li>
  <li data-n="26">Are every one a woe, a sore complaint,</li>
  <li data-n="27">’Gainst him whose wrongs gives edge unto the swords</li>
  <li data-n="28">That makes such waste in brief mortality.</li>
  <li data-n="29">Under this conjuration speak, my lord;</li>
  <li data-n="30">For we will hear, note, and believe in heart,</li>
  <li data-n="31">That what you speak is in your conscience wash’d</li>
  <li data-n="32">As pure as sin with baptism.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="CANT.">
  <li data-n="33">Then hear me, gracious sovereign, and you peers,</li>
  <li data-n="34">That owe yourselves, your lives, and services</li>
  <li data-n="35">To this imperial throne. There is no bar</li>
  <li data-n="36">To make against your Highness’ claim to France</li>
  <li data-n="37">But this, which they produce from Pharamond:</li>
  <li data-n="38">“<span data-l="la">In terram Salicam mulieres ne succedant,</span>”</li>
  <li data-n="39">“No woman shall succeed in Salique land”;</li>
  <li data-n="40">Which Salique land the French unjustly gloze</li>
  <li data-n="41">To be the realm of France, and Pharamond</li>
  <li data-n="42">The founder of this law and female bar.</li>
  <li data-n="43">Yet their own authors faithfully affirm</li>
  <li data-n="44">That the land Salique is in Germany,</li>
  <li data-n="45">Between the floods of Sala and of Elbe;</li>
  <li data-n="46">Where Charles the Great, having subdu’d the Saxons,</li>
  <li data-n="47">There left behind and settled certain French;</li>
  <li data-n="48">Who holding in disdain the German women</li>
  <li data-n="49">For some dishonest manners of their life,</li>
  <li data-n="50">Establish’d then this law: to wit, no female</li>
  <li data-n="51">Should be inheritrix in Salique land;</li>
  <li data-n="52">Which Salique, as I said, ’twixt Elbe and Sala,</li>
  <li data-n="53">Is at this day in Germany call’d Meisen.</li>
  <li data-n="54">Then doth it well appear the Salique law</li>
  <li data-n="55">Was not devised for the realm of France;</li>
  <li data-n="56">Nor did the French possess the Salique land</li>
  <li data-n="57">Until four hundred one and twenty years</li>
  <li data-n="58">After defunction of King Pharamond,</li>
  <li data-n="59">Idly suppos’d the founder of this law,</li>
  <li data-n="60">Who died within the year of our redemption</li>
  <li data-n="61">Four hundred twenty-six; and Charles the Great</li>
  <li data-n="62">Subdu’d the Saxons, and did seat the French</li>
  <li data-n="63">Beyond the river Sala, in the year</li>
  <li data-n="64">Eight hundred five. Besides, their writers say,</li>
  <li data-n="65">King Pepin, which deposed Childeric,</li>
  <li data-n="66">Did, as heir general, being descended</li>
  <li data-n="67">Of Blithild, which was daughter to King Clothair,</li>
  <li data-n="68">Make claim and title to the crown of France.</li>
  <li data-n="69">Hugh Capet also, who usurp’d the crown</li>
  <li data-n="70">Of Charles the Duke of Lorraine, sole heir male</li>
  <li data-n="71">Of the true line and stock of Charles the Great,</li>
  <li data-n="72">To fine his title with some shows of truth,</li>
  <li data-n="73">Though in pure truth it was corrupt and naught,</li>
  <li data-n="74">Convey’d himself as th’ heir to th’ Lady Lingare,</li>
  <li data-n="75">Daughter to Charlemain, who was the son</li>
  <li data-n="76">To Lewis the Emperor, and Lewis the son</li>
  <li data-n="77">Of Charles the Great. Also King Lewis the Tenth,</li>
  <li data-n="78">Who was sole heir to the usurper Capet,</li>
  <li data-n="79">Could not keep quiet in his conscience,</li>
  <li data-n="80">Wearing the crown of France, till satisfied</li>
  <li data-n="81">That fair Queen Isabel, his grandmother,</li>
  <li data-n="82">Was lineal of the Lady Ermengare,</li>
  <li data-n="83">Daughter to Charles, the foresaid Duke of Lorraine;</li>
  <li data-n="84">By the which marriage the line of Charles the Great</li>
  <li data-n="85">Was re-united to the crown of France.</li>
  <li data-n="86">So that, as clear as is the summer’s sun,</li>
  <li data-n="87">King Pepin’s title and Hugh Capet’s claim,</li>
  <li data-n="88">King Lewis his satisfaction, all appear</li>
  <li data-n="89">To hold in right and title of the female;</li>
  <li data-n="90">So do the kings of France unto this day.</li>
  <li data-n="91">Howbeit, they would hold up this Salique law</li>
  <li data-n="92">To bar your Highness claiming from the female,</li>
  <li data-n="93">And rather choose to hide them in a net</li>
  <li data-n="94">Than amply to imbar their crooked titles</li>
  <li data-n="95">Usurp’d from you and your progenitors.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="K. HEN.">
  <li data-n="96">May I with right and conscience make this claim?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="CANT.">
  <li data-n="97">The sin upon my head, dread sovereign!</li>
  <li data-n="98">For in the book of Numbers is it writ,</li>
  <li data-n="99">When the man dies, let the inheritance</li>
  <li data-n="100">Descend unto the daughter. Gracious lord,</li>
  <li data-n="101">Stand for your own, unwind your bloody flag,</li>
  <li data-n="102">Look back into your mighty ancestors;</li>
  <li data-n="103">Go, my dread lord, to your great-grandsire’s tomb,</li>
  <li data-n="104">From whom you claim; invoke his warlike spirit,</li>
  <li data-n="105">And your great-uncle’s, Edward the Black Prince,</li>
  <li data-n="106">Who on the French ground play’d a tragedy,</li>
  <li data-n="107">Making defeat on the full power of France,</li>
  <li data-n="108">Whiles his most mighty father on a hill</li>
  <li data-n="109">Stood smiling to behold his lion’s whelp</li>
  <li data-n="110">Forage in blood of French nobility.</li>
  <li data-n="111">O noble English, that could entertain</li>
  <li data-n="112">With half their forces the full pride of France,</li>
  <li data-n="113">And let another half stand laughing by,</li>
  <li data-n="114">All out of work and cold for action!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ELY.">
  <li data-n="115">Awake remembrance of these valiant dead,</li>
  <li data-n="116">And with your puissant arm renew their feats.</li>
  <li data-n="117">You are their heir, you sit upon their throne;</li>
  <li data-n="118">The blood and courage that renowned them</li>
  <li data-n="119">Runs in your veins; and my thrice-puissant liege</li>
  <li data-n="120">Is in the very May-morn of his youth,</li>
  <li data-n="121">Ripe for exploits and mighty enterprises.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="EXE.">
  <li data-n="122">Your brother kings and monarchs of the earth</li>
  <li data-n="123">Do all expect that you should rouse yourself,</li>
  <li data-n="124">As did the former lions of your blood.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="WEST.">
  <li data-n="125">They know your Grace hath cause, and means, and might;</li>
  <li data-n="126">So hath your Highness. Never King of England</li>
  <li data-n="127">Had nobles richer and more loyal subjects,</li>
  <li data-n="128">Whose hearts have left their bodies here in England,</li>
  <li data-n="129">And lie pavilion’d in the fields of France.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="CANT.">
  <li data-n="130">O, let their bodies follow, my dear liege,</li>
  <li data-n="131">With blood and sword and fire, to win your right;</li>
  <li data-n="132">In aid whereof we of the spiritually</li>
  <li data-n="133">Will raise your Highness such a mighty sum</li>
  <li data-n="134">As never did the clergy at one time</li>
  <li data-n="135">Bring in to any of your ancestors.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="K. HEN.">
  <li data-n="136">We must not only arm t’ invade the French,</li>
  <li data-n="137">But lay down our proportions to defend</li>
  <li data-n="138">Against the Scot, who will make road upon us</li>
  <li data-n="139">With all advantages.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="CANT.">
  <li data-n="140">They of those marches, gracious sovereign,</li>
  <li data-n="141">Shall be a wall sufficient to defend</li>
  <li data-n="142">Our inland from the pilfering borderers.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="K. HEN.">
  <li data-n="143">We do not mean the coursing snatchers only,</li>
  <li data-n="144">But fear the main intendment of the Scot,</li>
  <li data-n="145">Who hath been still a giddy neighbor to us;</li>
  <li data-n="146">For you shall read that my great-grandfather</li>
  <li data-n="147">Never went with his forces into France</li>
  <li data-n="148">But that the Scot on his unfurnish’d kingdom</li>
  <li data-n="149">Came pouring like the tide into a breach,</li>
  <li data-n="150">With ample and brim fullness of his force,</li>
  <li data-n="151">Galling the gleaned land with hot assays,</li>
  <li data-n="152">Girding with grievous siege castles and towns;</li>
  <li data-n="153">That England being empty of defense,</li>
  <li data-n="154">Hath shook and trembled at th’ ill neighborhood.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="CANT.">
  <li data-n="155">She hath been then more fear’d than harm’d, my liege;</li>
  <li data-n="156">For hear her but exampled by herself:</li>
  <li data-n="157">When all her chevalry hath been in France,</li>
  <li data-n="158">And she a mourning widow of her nobles,</li>
  <li data-n="159">She hath herself not only well defended</li>
  <li data-n="160">But taken and impounded as a stray</li>
  <li data-n="161">The King of Scots; whom she did send to France</li>
  <li data-n="162">To fill King Edward’s fame with prisoner kings,</li>
  <li data-n="163">And make her chronicle as rich with praise</li>
  <li data-n="164">As is the ooze and bottom of the sea</li>
  <li data-n="165">With sunken wrack and sumless treasuries.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ELY.">
  <li data-n="166">But there’s a saying very old and true,</li>
  <li data-n="167"><recite>“If that you will France win,</recite></li>
  <li data-n="168"><recite>Then with Scotland first begin.”</recite></li>
  <li data-n="169">For once the eagle (England) being in prey,</li>
  <li data-n="170">To her unguarded nest the weasel (Scot)</li>
  <li data-n="171">Comes sneaking, and so sucks her princely eggs,</li>
  <li data-n="172">Playing the mouse in absence of the cat,</li>
  <li data-n="173">To ’tame and havoc more than she can eat.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="EXE.">
  <li data-n="174">It follows then the cat must stay at home,</li>
  <li data-n="175">Yet that is but a crush’d necessity,</li>
  <li data-n="176">Since we have locks to safeguard necessaries,</li>
  <li data-n="177">And pretty traps to catch the petty thieves.</li>
  <li data-n="178">While that the armed hand doth fight abroad,</li>
  <li data-n="179">Th’ advised head defends itself at home;</li>
  <li data-n="180">For government, though high, and low, and lower,</li>
  <li data-n="181">Put into parts, doth keep in one consent,</li>
  <li data-n="182">Congreeing in a full and natural close,</li>
  <li data-n="183">Like music.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="CANT.">
  <li data-n="184">Therefore doth heaven divide</li>
  <li data-n="185">The state of man in diverse functions,</li>
  <li data-n="186">Setting endeavor in continual motion;</li>
  <li data-n="187">To which is fixed, as an aim or butt,</li>
  <li data-n="188">Obedience; for so work the honey-bees,</li>

  <li data-n="238">May’t please your Majesty to give us leave</li>

<ol data-s="K. HEN.">
  <li data-n="242">We are no tyrant, but a Christian king,</li>

  <li data-n="245">Therefore with frank and with uncurbed plainness</li>
  <li data-n="246">Tell us the Dauphin’s mind.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="1. AMB.">
  <li data-n="246" data-o="5">Thus then in few:</li>
  <li data-n="247">Your Highness, lately sending into France,</li>
  <li data-n="248">Did claim some certain dukedoms, in the right</li>
  <li data-n="249">Of your great predecessor, King Edward the Third.</li>
  <li data-n="250">In answer of which claim, the prince our master</li>
  <li data-n="251">Says that you savor too much of your youth,</li>
  <li data-n="252">And bids you be advis’d: there’s nought in France</li>
  <li data-n="253">That can be with a nimble galliard won;</li>
  <li data-n="254">You cannot revel into dukedoms there.</li>
  <li data-n="255">He therefore sends you, meeter for your spirit,</li>
  <li data-n="256">This tun of treasure; and, in lieu of this,</li>
  <li data-n="257">Desires you let the dukedoms that you claim</li>
  <li data-n="258">Hear no more of you. This the Dauphin speaks.</li>
</ol>

  <li data-n="259">What treasure, uncle?</li>

<ol data-s="K. HEN.">
  <li data-n="260">We are glad the Dauphin is so pleasant with us,</li>
  <li data-n="261">His present and your pains we thank you for.</li>
  <li data-n="262">When we have match’d our rackets to these balls,</li>
  <li data-n="263">We will in France, by God’s grace, play a set</li>
  <li data-n="264">Shall strike his father’s crown into the hazard.</li>
  <li data-n="265">Tell him he hath made a match with such a wrangler</li>
  <li data-n="266">That all the courts of France will be disturb’d</li>
  <li data-n="267">With chaces. And we understand him well,</li>
  <li data-n="268">How he comes o’er us with our wilder days,</li>
  <li data-n="269">Not measuring what use we made of them.</li>
  <li data-n="270">We never valu’d this poor seat of England,</li>
  <li data-n="271">And therefore, living hence, did give ourself</li>
  <li data-n="272">To barbarous license; as ’tis ever common</li>
  <li data-n="273">That men are merriest when they are from home.</li>
  <li data-n="274">But tell the Dauphin I will keep my state,</li>
  <li data-n="275">Be like a king, and show my sail of greatness</li>
  <li data-n="276">When I do rouse me in my throne of France.</li>
  <li data-n="277">For that I have laid by my majesty,</li>
  <li data-n="278">And plodded like a man for working-days;</li>
  <li data-n="279">But I will rise there with so full a glory</li>
  <li data-n="280">That I will dazzle all the eyes of France,</li>
  <li data-n="281">Yea, strike the Dauphin blind to look on us.</li>
  <li data-n="282">And tell the pleasant prince this mock of his</li>
  <li data-n="283">Hath turn’d his balls to gun-stones, and his soul</li>
  <li data-n="284">Shall stand sore charged for the wasteful vengeance</li>
  <li data-n="285">That shall fly with them; for many a thousand widows</li>
  <li data-n="286">Shall this his mock mock out of their dear husbands;</li>
  <li data-n="287">Mock mothers from their sons, mock castles down;</li>
  <li data-n="288">And some are yet ungotten and unborn</li>
  <li data-n="289">That shall have cause to curse the Dauphin’s scorn.</li>
  <li data-n="290">But this lies all within the will of God,</li>
  <li data-n="291">To whom I do appeal, and in whose name</li>
  <li data-n="292">Tell you the Dauphin I am coming on</li>
  <li data-n="293">To venge me as I may, and to put forth</li>
  <li data-n="294">My rightful hand in a well-hallow’d cause.</li>
  <li data-n="295">So get you hence in peace; and tell the Dauphin</li>
  <li data-n="296">His jest will savor but of shallow wit,</li>
  <li data-n="297">When thousands weep more than did laugh at it.—</li>

  <li data-n="1">Well met, Corporal Nym.</li>

  <li data-n="2">Good morrow, Lieutenant Bardolph.</li>

  <li data-n="4">For my part, I care not; I say little; but when time shall serve, there shall be smiles—but that shall be as it may. I dare not fight, but I will wink and hold out mine iron.

  <li data-n="7">It is certain, corporal, that he is married to Nell Quickly, and certainly she did you wrong, for you were troth-plight to her.</li>

  <li data-n="102">That might annoy my finger? ’Tis so strange,</li>
  <li data-n="103">That, though the truth of it stands off as gross</li>
  <li data-n="104">As black and white, my eye will scarcely see it.</li>
  <li data-n="105">Treason and murder ever kept together,</li>
  <li data-n="106">As two yoke-devils sworn to either’s purpose,</li>
  <li data-n="107">Working so grossly in a natural cause</li>
  <li data-n="108">That admiration did not hoop at them;</li>
  <li data-n="109">But thou (’gainst all proportion) didst bring in</li>
  <li data-n="110">Wonder to wait on treason and on murder;</li>
  <li data-n="111">And whatsoever cunning fiend it was</li>
  <li data-n="112">That wrought upon thee so preposterously</li>
  <li data-n="113">Hath got the voice in hell for excellence;</li>

  <li data-n="118">But he that temper’d thee, bade thee stand up,</li>
  <li data-n="119">Gave thee no instance why thou shouldst do treason,</li>
  <li data-n="120">Unless to dub thee with the name of traitor.</li>
  <li data-n="121">If that same demon that hath gull’d thee thus</li>
  <li data-n="122">Should with his lion gait walk the whole world,</li>
  <li data-n="123">He might return to vasty Tartar back,</li>
  <li data-n="124">And tell the legions, “I can never win</li>
  <li data-n="125">A soul so easy as that Englishman’s.”</li>
  <li data-n="126">O, how hast thou with jealousy infected</li>
  <li data-n="127">The sweetness of affiance! Show men dutiful?</li>
  <li data-n="128">Why, so didst thou. Seem they grave and learned?</li>
  <li data-n="129">Why, so didst thou. Come they of noble family?</li>
  <li data-n="130">Why, so didst thou. Seem they religious?</li>

  <li data-n="7">Nay sure, he’s not in hell; he’s in Arthur’s bosom, if ever man went to Arthur’s bosom. ’A made a finer end, and went away and it had been any christom child. ’A parted ev’n just between twelve and one, ev’n at the turning o’ th’ tide; for after I saw him fumble with the sheets, and play with flowers, and smile upon his finger’s end, I knew there was but one way; for his nose was as sharp as a pen, and ’a babbl’d of green fields. “How now, Sir John?” quoth I, “what, man? Be a’ good cheer.” So ’a cried out, “God, God, God!” three or four times. Now I, to comfort him, bid him ’a should not think of God; I hop’d there was no need to trouble himself with any such thoughts yet. So ’a bade me lay more clothes on his feet. I put my hand into the bed and felt them, and they were as cold as any stone; then I felt to his knees, and so up’ard and up’ard, and all was as cold as any stone.</li>

I am boy to them all three, but all they three, though they would serve me, could not be man to me; for indeed three such antics do not amount to a man. For Bardolph, he is white-liver’d and red-fac’d; by the means whereof ’a faces it out, but fights not. For Pistol, he hath a killing tongue and a quiet sword; by the means whereof ’a breaks words, and keeps whole weapons. For Nym, he hath heard that men of few words are the best men, and therefore he scorns to say his prayers, lest ’a should be thought a coward; but his few bad words are match’d with as few good deeds; for ’a never broke any man’s head but his own, and that was against a post when he was drunk. They will steal any thing, and call it purchase. Bardolph stole a lute-case, bore it twelve leagues, and sold it for three half-pence. Nym and Bardolph are sworn brothers in filching, and in Callice they stole a fire-shovel. I knew by that piece of service the men would carry coals. They would have me as familiar with men’s pockets as their gloves or their handkerchers; which makes much against my manhood, if I should take from another’s pocket to put into mine; for it is plain pocketing up of wrongs. I must leave them, and seek some better service. Their villainy goes against my weak stomach, and therefore I must cast it up.</li>

</ol>

<ol data-s="GOW.">
  <li data-n="3">Is the Duke of Exeter safe?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="FLU.">
  <li data-n="4">The Duke of Exeter is as magnanimous as Agamemnon, and a man that I love and honor with my soul, and my heart, and my duty, and my live, and my living, and my uttermost power. He is not—God be praised and blessed!—any hurt in the world, but keeps the bridge most valiantly, with excellent discipline. There is an aunchient lieutenant there at the pridge, I think in my very conscience he is as valiant a man as Mark Antony, and he is a man of no estimation in the world, but I did see him do as gallant service.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="GOW.">
  <li data-n="5">What do you call him?</li>

  <li data-n="10">The Duke of Exeter doth love thee well.</li>

  <li data-n="11">Ay, I praise God, and I have merited some love at his hands.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="PIST.">
  <li data-n="12">Bardolph, a soldier firm and sound of heart,</li>
  <li data-n="13">And of buxom valor, hath by cruel fate,</li>
  <li data-n="14">And giddy Fortune’s furious fickle wheel,</li>
  <li data-n="15">That goddess blind,</li>
  <li data-n="16">That stands upon the rolling restless stone—</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="FLU.">
  <li data-n="17">By your patience, Aunchient Pistol: Fortune is painted blind, with a muffler afore his eyes, to signify to you that Fortune is blind; and she is painted also with a wheel, to signify to you, which is the moral of it, that she is turning, and inconstant, and mutability, and variation; and her foot, look you, is fixed upon a spherical stone, which rolls, and rolls, and rolls. In good truth, the poet makes a most excellent description of it. Fortune is an excellent moral.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="PIST.">
  <li data-n="18">Fortune is Bardolph’s foe, and frowns on him;</li>
  <li data-n="19">For he hath stol’n a pax, and hanged must ’a be—</li>
  <li data-n="20">A damned death!</li>
  <li data-n="21">Let gallows gape for dog, let man go free,</li>
  <li data-n="22">And let not hemp his windpipe suffocate.</li>
  <li data-n="23">But Exeter hath given the doom of death</li>
  <li data-n="24">For pax of little price.</li>
  <li data-n="25">Therefore go speak, the Duke will hear thy voice;</li>
  <li data-n="26">And let not Bardolph’s vital thread be cut</li>
  <li data-n="27">With edge of penny cord and vile reproach.</li>
  <li data-n="28">Speak, captain, for his life, and I will thee requite.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="FLU.">
  <li data-n="29">Aunchient Pistol, I do partly understand your meaning.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="PIST.">
  <li data-n="30">Why then rejoice therefore.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="FLU.">
  <li data-n="31">Certainly, aunchient, it is not a thing to rejoice at; for if, look you, he were my brother, I would desire the Duke to use his good pleasure, and put him to execution; for discipline ought to be used.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="PIST.">

<ol data-s="GOW.">
  <li data-n="38">Why, ’tis a gull, a fool, a rogue, that now and then goes to the wars, to grace himself at his return into London under the form of a soldier. And such fellows are perfit in the great commanders’ names, and they will learn you by rote where services were done—at such and such a sconce, at such a breach, at such a convoy; who came off bravely, who was shot, who disgrac’d, what terms the enemy stood on; and this they con perfitly in the phrase of war, which they trick up with new-tun’d oaths; and what a beard of the general’s cut and a horrid suit of the camp will do among foaming bottles and ale-wash’d wits, is wonderful to be thought on. But you must learn to know such slanders of the age, or else you may be marvelously mistook.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="FLU.">
  <li data-n="39">I tell you what, Captain Gower: I do perceive he is not the man that he would gladly make show to the world he is. If I find a hole in his coat, I will tell him my mind.</li>

  <li data-n="45">The perdition of th’ athversary hath been very great, reasonable great. Marry, for my part, I think the Duke hath lost never a man, but one that is like to be executed for robbing a church, one Bardolph, if your Majesty know the man. His face is all bubukles, and whelks, and knobs, and flames a’ fire, and his lips blows at his nose, and it is like a coal of fire, sometimes plue and sometimes red, but his nose is executed, and his fire’s out.</li>

Now we speak upon our cue, and our voice is imperial: England shall repent his folly, see his weakness, and admire our sufferance. Bid him therefore consider of his ransom, which must proportion the losses we have borne, the subjects we have lost, the disgrace we have digested; which in weight to re-answer, his pettiness would bow under. For our losses, his exchequer is too poor; for th’ effusion of our blood, the muster of his kingdom too faint a number; and for our disgrace, his own person kneeling at our feet but a weak and worthless satisfaction.

	Enter the Constable of France, the Lord Rambures, Orléans, Dauphin, with others.
	
		CON.
		RAM.
		ORL.
		DAU.
	
</div>

<ol data-s="CON.">
  <li data-n="1">Tut, I have the best armor of the world. Would it were day!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ORL.">
  <li data-n="2">You have an excellent armor; but let my horse have his due.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="CON.">
  <li data-n="3">It is the best horse of Europe.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ORL.">
  <li data-n="4">Will it never be morning?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="DAU.">
  <li data-n="5">My Lord of Orléans, and my Lord High Constable, you talk of horse and armor?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ORL.">
  <li data-n="6">You are as well provided of both as any prince in the world.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="DAU.">
  <li data-n="7">What a long night is this! I will not change my horse with any that treads but on four pasterns. <span data-l="fr">Ça, ha!</span> He bounds from the earth, as if his entrails were hairs; <span data-l="fr">le cheval volant, the Pegasus, chez les narines de feu!</span> When I bestride him, I soar, I am a hawk; he trots the air; the earth sings when he touches it; the basest horn of his hoof is more musical than the pipe of Hermes.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ORL.">
  <li data-n="8">He’s of the color of the nutmeg.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="DAU.">
  <li data-n="9">And of the heat of the ginger. It is a beast for Perseus. He is pure air and fire; and the dull elements of earth and water never appear in him, but only in patient stillness while his rider mounts him. He is indeed a horse, and all other jades you may call beasts.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="CON.">
  <li data-n="10">Indeed, my lord, it is a most absolute and excellent horse.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="DAU.">
  <li data-n="11">It is the prince of palfreys: his neigh is like the bidding of a monarch, and his countenance enforces homage.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ORL.">
  <li data-n="12">No more, cousin.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="DAU.">
  <li data-n="13">Nay, the man hath no wit that cannot, from the rising of the lark to the lodging of the lamb, vary deserv’d praise on my palfrey. It is a theme as fluent as the sea; turn the sands into eloquent tongues, and my horse is argument for them all. ’Tis a subject for a sovereign to reason on, and for a sovereign’s sovereign to ride on; and for the world, familiar to us and unknown, to lay apart their particular functions and wonder at him. I once writ a sonnet in his praise and began thus: “Wonder of nature”—</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ORL.">
  <li data-n="14">I have heard a sonnet begin so to one’s mistress.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="DAU.">
  <li data-n="15">Then did they imitate that which I compos’d to my courser, for my horse is my mistress.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ORL.">
  <li data-n="16">Your mistress bears well.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="DAU.">
  <li data-n="17">Me well, which is the prescript praise and perfection of a good and particular mistress.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="CON.">
  <li data-n="18">Nay, for methought yesterday your mistress shrewdly shook your back.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="DAU.">
  <li data-n="19">So perhaps did yours.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="CON.">
  <li data-n="20">Mine was not bridled.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="DAU.">
  <li data-n="21">O then belike she was old and gentle, and you rode like a kern of Ireland, your French hose off, and in your strait strossers.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="CON.">
  <li data-n="22">You have good judgment in horsemanship.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="DAU.">
  <li data-n="23">Be warn’d by me then: they that ride so, and ride not warily, fall into foul bogs. I had rather have my horse to my mistress.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="CON.">
  <li data-n="24">I had as lief have my mistress a jade.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="DAU.">
  <li data-n="25">I tell thee, Constable, my mistress wears his own hair.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="CON.">

</ol>

<ol data-s="RAM.">
  <li data-n="29">My Lord Constable, the armor that I saw in your tent tonight, are those stars or suns upon it?</li>

  <li data-n="32">And yet my sky shall not want.</li>

<ol data-s="DAU.">
  <li data-n="33">That may be, for you bear a many superfluously, and ’twere more honor some were away.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="CON.">
  <li data-n="34">Ev’n as your horse bears your praises, who would trot as well, were some of your brags dismounted.</li>

<ol data-s="CON.">
  <li data-n="36">I will not say so, for fear I should be fac’d out of my way. But I would it were morning, for I would fain be about the ears of the English.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="RAM.">
  <li data-n="37">Who will go to hazard with me for twenty prisoners?</li>

  <li data-n="81">He may show what outward courage he will; but I believe, as cold a night as ’tis, he could wish himself in Thames up to the neck; and so I would he were, and I by him, at all adventures, so we were quit here.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="K. HEN.">
  <li data-n="82">By my troth, I will speak my conscience of the King: I think he would not wish himself any where but where he is.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="BATES.">
  <li data-n="83">Then I would he were here alone; so should he be sure to be ransom’d, and a many poor men’s lives sav’d.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="K. HEN.">
  <li data-n="84">I dare say you love him not so ill to wish him here alone, howsoever you speak this to feel other men’s minds. Methinks I could not die any where so contented as in the King’s company, his cause being just and his quarrel honorable.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="WILL.">
  <li data-n="85">That’s more than we know.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="BATES.">
  <li data-n="86">Ay, or more than we should seek after; for we know enough, if we know we are the King’s subjects. If his cause be wrong, our obedience to the King wipes the crime of it out of us.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="WILL.">
  <li data-n="87">But if the cause be not good, the King himself hath a heavy reckoning to make, when all those legs, and arms, and heads, chopp’d off in a battle, shall join together at the latter day and cry all, “We died at such a place”—some swearing, some crying for a surgeon, some upon their wives left poor behind them, some upon the debts they owe, some upon their children rawly left. I am afeard there are few die well that die in a battle; for how can they charitably dispose of any thing, when blood is their argument? Now, if these men do not die well, it will be a black matter for the King that led them to it; who to disobey were against all proportion of subjection.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="K. HEN.">
  <li data-n="88">So, if a son that is by his father sent about merchandise do sinfully miscarry upon the sea, the imputation of his wickedness, by your rule, should be impos’d upon his father that sent him; or if a servant, under his master’s command transporting a sum of money, be assail’d by robbers and die in many irreconcil’d iniquities, you may call the business of the master the author of the servant’s damnation. But this is not so. The King is not bound to answer the particular endings of his soldiers, the father of his son, nor the master of his servant; for they purpose not their death when they purpose their services. Besides, there is no king, be his cause never so spotless, if it come to the arbitrement of swords, can try it out with all unspotted soldiers. Some, peradventure, have on them the guilt of premeditated and contriv’d murder; some, of beguiling virgins with the broken seals of perjury; some, making the wars their bulwark, that have before gor’d the gentle bosom of peace with pillage and robbery. Now, if these men have defeated the law and outrun native punishment, though they can outstrip men, they have no wings to fly from God. War is his beadle, war is his vengeance; so that here men are punish’d for before-breach of the King’s laws in now the King’s quarrel. Where they fear’d the death, they have borne life away; and where they would be safe, they perish. Then if they die unprovided, no more is the King guilty of their damnation than he was before guilty of those impieties for the which they are now visited. Every subject’s duty is the King’s, but every subject’s soul is his own. Therefore should every soldier in the wars do as every sick man in his bed, wash every mote out of his conscience; and dying so, death is to him advantage; or not dying, the time was blessedly lost wherein such preparation was gain’d; and in him that escapes, it were not sin to think that making God so free an offer, He let him outlive that day to see His greatness and to teach others how they should prepare.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="WILL.">
  <li data-n="89">’Tis certain, every man that dies ill, the ill upon his own head, the King is not to answer it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="BATES.">
  <li data-n="90">I do not desire he should answer for me, and yet I determine to fight lustily for him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="K. HEN.">
  <li data-n="91">I myself heard the King say he would not be ransom’d.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="WILL.">
  <li data-n="92">Ay, he said so, to make us fight cheerfully; but when our throats are cut, he may be ransom’d, and we ne’er the wiser.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="K. HEN.">
  <li data-n="93">If I live to see it, I will never trust his word after.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="WILL.">
  <li data-n="94">You pay him then. That’s a perilous shot out of an elder-gun, that a poor and a private displeasure can do against a monarch! You may as well go about to turn the sun to ice with fanning in his face with a peacock’s feather. You’ll never trust his word after! Come, ’tis a foolish saying.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="K. HEN.">
  <li data-n="95">Your reproof is something too round, I should be angry with you, if the time were convenient.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="WILL.">
  <li data-n="96">Let it be a quarrel between us, if you live.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="K. HEN.">

  <li data-n="105"><span data-l="fr">Pardonnez-moi</span>, I cannot tell wat is “like me.”</li>

<ol data-s="ALICE.">
  <li data-n="108"><span data-l="fr">Oui, vraiment, sauf votre grâce, ainsi dit-il.</span></li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="K. HEN.">
  <li data-n="109">I said so, dear Katherine, and I must not blush to affirm it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="KATH.">
  <li data-n="110"><span data-l="fr">O bon Dieu! Les langues des hommes sont pleines de tromperies.</span></li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="K. HEN.">
  <li data-n="111">What says she, fair one? That the tongues of men are full of deceits?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ALICE.">
  <li data-n="112"><span data-l="fr">Oui, dat de tongeus of de mans is be full of deceits: dat is de Princess.</span></li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="K. HEN.">
  <li data-n="113">The Princess is the better Englishwoman. I’ faith, Kate, my wooing is fit for thy understanding. I am glad thou canst speak no better English, for if thou couldst, thou wouldst find me such a plain king that thou wouldst think I had sold my farm to buy my crown. I know no ways to mince it in love, but directly to say “I love you”; then if you urge me farther than to say “Do you in faith?” I wear out my suit. Give me your answer, i’ faith, do, and so clap hands and a bargain. How say you, lady?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="KATH.">
  <li data-n="114"><span data-l="fr">Sauf votre honneur</span>, me understand well.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="K. HEN.">
  <li data-n="115">Marry, if you would put me to verses, or to dance for your sake, Kate, why, you undid me: for the one, I have neither words nor measure; and for the other, I have no strength in measure, yet a reasonable measure in strength. If I could win a lady at leap-frog, or by vaulting into my saddle with my armor on my back, under the correction of bragging be it spoken, I should quickly leap into a wife. Or if I might buffet for my love, or bound my horse for her favors, I could lay on like a butcher, and sit like a jack-an-apes, never off. But, before God, Kate, I cannot look greenly, nor gasp out my eloquence, nor I have no cunning in protestation; only downright oaths, which I never use till urg’d, nor never break for urging. If thou canst love a fellow of this temper, Kate, whose face is not worth sunburning, that never looks in his glass for love of any thing he sees there, let thine eye be thy cook. I speak to thee plain soldier. If thou canst love me for this, take me! If not, to say to thee that I shall die, is true; but for thy love, by the Lord, no; yet I love thee too. And while thou liv’st, dear Kate, take a fellow of plain and uncoin’d constancy, for he perforce must do thee right, because he hath not the gift to woo in other places; for these fellows of infinite tongue, that can rhyme themselves into ladies’ favors, they do always reason themselves out again. What? A speaker is but a prater, a rhyme is but a ballad; a good leg will fall, a straight back will stoop, a black beard will turn white, a curl’d pate will grow bald, a fair face will wither, a full eye will wax hollow; but a good heart, Kate, is the sun and the moon, or rather the sun and not the moon; for it shines bright and never changes, but keeps his course truly. If thou would have such a one, take me! And take me, take a soldier; take a soldier, take a king. And what say’st thou then to my love? Speak, my fair, and fairly, I pray thee.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="KATH.">
  <li data-n="116">Is it possible dat I sould love de ennemie of France?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="K. HEN.">
  <li data-n="117">No, it is not possible you should love the enemy of France, Kate; but in loving me, you should love the friend of France; for I love France so well that I will not part with a village of it; I will have it all mine. And, Kate, when France is mine and I am yours, then yours is France and you are mine.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="KATH.">
  <li data-n="118">I cannot tell wat is dat.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="K. HEN.">
  <li data-n="119">No, Kate? I will tell thee in French, which I am sure will hang upon my tongue like a new-married wife about her husband’s neck, hardly to be shook off. <span data-l="fr">Je quand sur le possession de France, et quand vous avez le possession de moi</span>—let me see, what then? Saint Denis be my speed!—<span data-l="fr">donc votre est France et vous êtes mienne</span>. It is as easy for me, Kate, to conquer the kingdom as to speak so much more French. I shall never move thee in French, unless it be to laugh at me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="KATH.">
  <li data-n="120"><span data-l="fr">Sauf votre honneur, le François que vous parlez, il est meilleur que l’Anglois lequel je parle.</span></li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="K. HEN.">
  <li data-n="121">No, faith, is’t not, Kate; but thy speaking of my tongue, and I thine, most truly falsely, must needs be granted to be much at one. But, Kate, dost thou understand thus much English? Canst thou love me?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="KATH.">
  <li data-n="122">I cannot tell.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="K. HEN.">
  <li data-n="123">Can any of your neighbors tell, Kate? I’ll ask them. Come, I know thou lovest me; and at night, when you come into your closet, you’ll question this gentlewoman about me; and I know, Kate, you will to her dispraise those parts in me that you love with your heart. But, good Kate, mock me mercifully, the rather, gentle Princess, because I love thee cruelly. If ever thou beest mine, Kate, as I have a saving faith within me tells me thou shalt, I get thee with scambling, and thou must therefore needs prove a good soldier-breeder. Shall not thou and I, between Saint Denis and Saint George, compound a boy, half French, half English, that shall go to Constantinople and take the Turk by the beard? Shall we not? What say’st thou, my fair flower-de-luce?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="KATH.">
  <li data-n="124">I do not know dat.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="K. HEN.">
  <li data-n="125">No; ’tis hereafter to know, but now to promise. Do but now promise, Kate, you will endeavor for your French part of such a boy; and for my English moi’ty, take the word of a king and a bachelor. How answer you, <span data-l="fr">la plus belle Katherine du monde, mon très cher et devin déesse</span>?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="KATH.">
  <li data-n="126">Your Majestee ave fausse French enough to deceive de most sage demoiselle dat is en France.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="K. HEN.">
  <li data-n="127">Now fie upon my false French! By mine honor, in true English, I love thee, Kate; by which honor I dare not swear thou lovest me, yet my blood begins to flatter me that thou dost—notwithstanding the poor and untempering effect of my visage. Now beshrew my father’s ambition! He was thinking of civil wars when he got me; therefore was I created with a stubborn outside, with an aspect of iron, that when I come to woo ladies, I fright them. But in faith, Kate, the elder I wax, the better I shall appear. My comfort is, that old age, that ill layer-up of beauty, can do no more spoil upon my face. Thou hast me, if thou hast me, at the worst; and thou shalt wear me, if thou wear me, better and better; and therefore tell me, most fair Katherine, will you have me? Put off your maiden blushes, avouch the thoughts of your heart with the looks of an empress, take me by the hand, and say, “Harry of England, I am thine”; which word thou shalt no sooner bless mine ear withal, but I will tell thee aloud, “England is thine, Ireland is thine, France is thine, and Henry Plantagenet is thine”; who, though I speak it before his face, if he be not fellow with the best king, thou shalt find the best king of good fellows. Come, your answer in broken music; for thy voice is music and thy English broken; therefore, queen of all, Katherine, break thy mind to me in broken English—wilt thou have me?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="KATH.">
  <li data-n="128">Dat is as it shall please de roi mon père.</li>

<ol data-s="BUR.">
  <li data-n="145">Is she not apt?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="K. HEN.">
  <li data-n="146">Our tongue is rough, coz, and my condition is not smooth; so that having neither the voice nor the heart of flattery about me, I cannot so conjure up the spirit of love in her, that he will appear in his true likeness.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="BUR.">
  <li data-n="147">Pardon the frankness of my mirth, if I answer you for that. If you would conjure in her, you must make a circle; if conjure up Love in her in his true likeness, he must appear naked and blind. Can you blame her then, being a maid yet ros’d over with the virgin crimson of modesty, if she deny the appearance of a naked blind boy in her naked seeing self? It were, my lord, a hard condition for a maid to consign to.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="K. HEN.">
  <li data-n="148">Yet they do wink and yield, as love is blind and enforces.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="BUR.">
  <li data-n="149">They are then excus’d, my lord, when they see not what they do.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="K. HEN.">
  <li data-n="150">Then, good my lord, teach your cousin to consent winking.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="BUR.">
  <li data-n="151">I will wink on her to consent, my lord, if you will teach her to know my meaning; for maids, well summer’d and warm kept, are like flies at <date when=" — 08-24" type="holiday" subtype="Christian">Bartholomew-tide</date>, blind, though they have their eyes, and then they will endure handling, which before would not abide looking on.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="K. HEN.">
  <li data-n="152">This moral ties me over to time and a hot summer; and so I shall catch the fly, your cousin, in the latter end, and she must be blind too.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="BUR.">
  <li data-n="153">As love is, my lord, before it loves.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="K. HEN.">
  <li data-n="154">It is so; and you may, some of you, thank love for my blindness, who cannot see many a fair French city for one fair French maid that stands in my way.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="FR. KING.">
  <li data-n="155">Yes, my lord, you see them perspectively: the cities turn’d into a maid; for they are all girdled with maiden walls that war hath never ent’red.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="K. HEN.">
  <li data-n="156">Shall Kate be my wife?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="FR. KING.">
  <li data-n="157">So please you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="K. HEN.">
  <li data-n="158">I am content, so the maiden cities you talk of may wait on her; so the maid that stood in the way for my wish shall show me the way to my will.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="FR. KING.">
  <li data-n="159">We have consented to all terms of reason.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="K. HEN.">
  <li data-n="160">Is’t so, my lords of England?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="WEST.">
  <li data-n="161">The King hath granted every article:</li>
  <li data-n="162">His daughter first; and in sequel, all,</li>
  <li data-n="163">According to their firm proposed natures.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="EXE.">
  <li data-n="164">Only he hath not yet subscribed this:</li>
  <li data-n="165">Where your Majesty demands that the King of France, having any occasion to write for matter of grant, shall name your Highness in this form, and with this addition, in French, <span data-l="fr">Notre très cher fils Henri, Roi d’Angleterre, Héritier de France</span>; and thus in Latin, <span data-l="la">Praeclarissimus filius noster Henricus, Rex Angliae, et Heres Franciae</span>.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="FR. KING.">
  <li data-n="166">Nor this I have not, brother, so denied,</li>
  <li data-n="167">But your request shall make me let it pass.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="K. HEN.">
  <li data-n="168">I pray you then, in love and dear alliance,</li>
  <li data-n="169">Let that one article rank with the rest,</li>
  <li data-n="170">And thereupon give me your daughter.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="FR. KING.">
  <li data-n="171">Take her, fair son, and from her blood raise up</li>
  <li data-n="172">Issue to me, that the contending kingdoms</li>
  <li data-n="173">Of France and England, whose very shores look pale</li>
  <li data-n="174">With envy of each other’s happiness,</li>
  <li data-n="175">May cease their hatred; and this dear conjunction</li>
  <li data-n="176">Plant neighborhood and Christian-like accord</li>
  <li data-n="177">In their sweet bosoms, that never war advance</li>
  <li data-n="178">His bleeding sword ’twixt England and fair France.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="LORDS.">
  <li data-n="179">Amen!</li>

<ol data-s="K. HEN.">
  <li data-n="180">Now welcome, Kate; and bear me witness all,</li>
