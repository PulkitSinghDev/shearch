<section class="stanza">
  <p data-n="1">From off a hill whose concave womb reworded</p>
  <p data-n="2">A plaintful story from a sist’ring vale,</p>
  <p data-n="3">My spirits t’ attend this double voice accorded,</p>
  <p data-n="4">And down I laid to list the sad-tun’d tale,</p>
  <p data-n="5">Ere long espied a fickle maid full pale</p>

  <p data-n="8">Upon her head a platted hive of straw,</p>
  <p data-n="9">Which fortified her visage from the sun,</p>
  <p data-n="10">Whereon the thought might think sometime it saw</p>
  <p data-n="11">The carcass of a beauty spent and done.</p>
  <p data-n="12">Time had not scythed all that youth begun,</p>
  <p data-n="13">Nor youth all quit, but spite of heaven’s fell rage,</p>
  <p data-n="14">Some beauty peep’d through lattice of sear’d age.</p>

  <p data-n="15">Oft did she heave her napkin to her eyne,</p>

  <p data-n="17">Laund’ring the silken figures in the brine</p>
  <p data-n="18">That seasoned woe had pelleted in tears,</p>
  <p data-n="19">And often reading what contents it bears;</p>

  <p data-n="25">To th’ orbed earth; sometimes they do extend</p>
  <p data-n="26">Their view right on; anon their gazes lend</p>
  <p data-n="27">To every place at once, and no where fix’d,</p>
  <p data-n="28">The mind and sight distractedly commix’d.</p>

  <p data-n="29">Her hair, nor loose nor tied in formal plat,</p>

  <p data-n="31">For some untuck’d descended her sheav’d hat,</p>
  <p data-n="32">Hanging her pale and pined cheek beside;</p>
  <p data-n="33">Some in her threaden fillet still did bide,</p>

  <p data-n="38">Which one by one she in a river threw,</p>
  <p data-n="39">Upon whose weeping margent she was set,</p>
  <p data-n="40">Like usury applying wet to wet,</p>
  <p data-n="41">Or monarch’s hands that lets not bounty fall</p>
  <p data-n="42">Where want cries some, but where excess begs all.</p>

  <p data-n="46">Bidding them find their sepulchres in mud,</p>
  <p data-n="47">Found yet more letters sadly penn’d in blood,</p>
  <p data-n="48">With sleided silk feat and affectedly</p>

  <p data-n="303">Applied to cautels, all strange forms receives,</p>
  <p data-n="304">Of burning blushes, or of weeping water,</p>
  <p data-n="305">Or sounding paleness; and he takes and leaves,</p>
  <p data-n="306">In either’s aptness as it best deceives,</p>
