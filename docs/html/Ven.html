<h1 id="title">Venus & Adonis</h1>

<section id="poemintro">
Vilia miretur vulgus: mihi flauus Apollo<br>Pocula Castalia plena ministret aqua.<br><br><br><br>To the Right Honorable Henry Wriothesley,<br>Earl of Southampton, and Baron of Titchfield.<br>Right Honorable, I know not how I shall offend in dedicating my unpolished lines to your Lordship, nor how the world will censor me for choosing so strong a prop to support so weak a burden, only if your Honor seem but pleased, I account myself highly praised, and vow to take advantage of all idle hours, until I have honored you with some graver labor. But if the first heir of my invention prove deformed, I shall be sorry it had so noble a godfather: and neverafter hear so barren a land, for fear it yield me still so bad a harvest. I leave it to your honorable survey, and your honor to your hearts content, which I wish may always answer your own wish, and the world's hopeful expectation.<br>Your honors in all duty,<br>William Shakespeare.
