<ol data-s="ANT.">
  <li data-n="1">In sooth, I know not why I am so sad;</li>
  <li data-n="2">It wearies me, you say it wearies you;</li>
  <li data-n="3">But how I caught it, found it, or came by it,</li>
  <li data-n="4">What stuff ’tis made of, whereof it is born,</li>
  <li data-n="5">I am to learn;</li>
  <li data-n="6">And such a want-wit sadness makes of me,</li>
  <li data-n="7">That I have much ado to know myself.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="SAL.">
  <li data-n="8">Your mind is tossing on the ocean,</li>
  <li data-n="9">There where your argosies with portly sail</li>
  <li data-n="10">Like <foreign xml:lang="it">signior</foreign>s and rich burghers on the flood,</li>
  <li data-n="11">Or as it were the pageants of the sea,</li>
  <li data-n="12">Do overpeer the petty traffickers</li>
  <li data-n="13">That cur’sy to them, do them reverence,</li>
  <li data-n="14">As they fly by them with their woven wings.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="SOL.">
  <li data-n="15">Believe me, sir, had I such venture forth,</li>
  <li data-n="16">The better part of my affections would</li>
  <li data-n="17">Be with my hopes abroad. I should be still</li>
  <li data-n="18">Plucking the grass to know where sits the wind,</li>
  <li data-n="19">Piring in maps for ports and piers and roads;</li>
  <li data-n="20">And every object that might make me fear</li>
  <li data-n="21">Misfortune to my ventures, out of doubt</li>
  <li data-n="22">Would make me sad.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="SAL.">
  <li data-n="22" data-o="4">My wind cooling my broth</li>
  <li data-n="23">Would blow me to an ague when I thought</li>
  <li data-n="24">What harm a wind too great might do at sea.</li>
  <li data-n="25">I should not see the sandy hour-glass run</li>
  <li data-n="26">But I should think of shallows and of flats,</li>
  <li data-n="27">And see my wealthy Andrew dock’d in sand,</li>
  <li data-n="28">Vailing her high top lower than her ribs</li>
  <li data-n="29">To kiss her burial. Should I go to church</li>
  <li data-n="30">And see the holy edifice of stone,</li>
  <li data-n="31">And not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks,</li>
  <li data-n="32">Which touching but my gentle vessel’s side</li>
  <li data-n="33">Would scatter all her spices on the stream,</li>
  <li data-n="34">Enrobe the roaring waters with my silks,</li>
  <li data-n="35">And in a word, but even now worth this,</li>
  <li data-n="36">And now worth nothing? Shall I have the thought</li>
  <li data-n="37">To think on this, and shall I lack the thought</li>
  <li data-n="38">That such a thing bechanc’d would make me sad?</li>
  <li data-n="39">But tell not me; I know Antonio</li>
  <li data-n="40">Is sad to think upon his merchandise.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ANT.">
  <li data-n="41">Believe me, no. I thank my fortune for it,</li>
  <li data-n="42">My ventures are not in one bottom trusted,</li>
  <li data-n="43">Nor to one place; nor is my whole estate</li>
  <li data-n="44">Upon the fortune of this present year:</li>
  <li data-n="45">Therefore my merchandise makes me not sad.</li>

  <li data-n="46" data-o="5">Fie, fie!</li>

<ol data-s="SOL.">
  <li data-n="47">Not in love neither? Then let us say you are sad</li>
  <li data-n="48">Because you are not merry; and ’twere as easy</li>
  <li data-n="49">For you to laugh and leap, and say you are merry</li>
  <li data-n="50">Because you are not sad. Now by two-headed Janus,</li>
  <li data-n="51">Nature hath fram’d strange fellows in her time:</li>
  <li data-n="52">Some that will evermore peep through their eyes,</li>
  <li data-n="53">And laugh like parrots at a bagpiper;</li>
  <li data-n="54">And other of such vinegar aspect</li>
  <li data-n="55">That they’ll not show their teeth in way of smile</li>

  <li data-n="66">Good <foreign xml:lang="it">signior</foreign>s both, when shall we laugh? Say, when?</li>
  <li data-n="67">You grow exceeding strange. Must it be so?</li>

  <li data-n="69">My Lord Bassanio, since you have found Antonio,</li>
  <li data-n="70">We two will leave you, but at dinner-time</li>
  <li data-n="71">I pray you have in mind where we must meet.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="BASS.">
  <li data-n="72">I will not fail you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="GRA.">
  <li data-n="73">You look not well, <foreign xml:lang="it">Signior</foreign> Antonio,</li>
  <li data-n="74">You have too much respect upon the world.</li>
  <li data-n="75">They lose it that do buy it with much care.</li>
  <li data-n="76">Believe me you are marvelously chang’d.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ANT.">
  <li data-n="77">I hold the world but as the world, Gratiano,</li>
  <li data-n="78">A stage, where every man must play a part,</li>
  <li data-n="79">And mine a sad one.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="GRA.">
  <li data-n="79" data-o="4">Let me play the fool,</li>
  <li data-n="80">With mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come,</li>
  <li data-n="81">And let my liver rather heat with wine</li>
  <li data-n="82">Than my heart cool with mortifying groans.</li>
  <li data-n="83">Why should a man, whose blood is warm within,</li>
  <li data-n="84">Sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster?</li>
  <li data-n="85">Sleep when he wakes? And creep into the jaundies</li>
  <li data-n="86">By being peevish? I tell thee what, Antonio—</li>
  <li data-n="87">I love thee, and ’tis my love that speaks—</li>
  <li data-n="88">There are a sort of men whose visages</li>
  <li data-n="89">Do cream and mantle like a standing pond,</li>
  <li data-n="90">And do a willful stillness entertain,</li>
  <li data-n="91">With purpose to be dress’d in an opinion</li>
  <li data-n="92">Of wisdom, gravity, profound conceit,</li>
  <li data-n="93">As who should say, “I am Sir Oracle,</li>
  <li data-n="94">And when I ope my lips let no dog bark!”</li>
  <li data-n="95">O my Antonio, I do know of these</li>
  <li data-n="96">That therefore only are reputed wise</li>
  <li data-n="97">For saying nothing; when I am very sure</li>
  <li data-n="98">If they should speak, would almost damn those ears</li>
  <li data-n="99">Which hearing them would call their brothers fools.</li>
  <li data-n="100">I’ll tell thee more of this another time;</li>
  <li data-n="101">But fish not with this melancholy bait</li>
  <li data-n="102">For this fool gudgeon, this opinion.</li>
  <li data-n="103">Come, good Lorenzo. Fare ye well a while,</li>
  <li data-n="104">I’ll end my exhortation after dinner.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="LOR.">
  <li data-n="105">Well, we will leave you then till dinner-time.</li>
  <li data-n="106">I must be one of these same dumb wise men,</li>
  <li data-n="107">For Gratiano never lets me speak.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="GRA.">
  <li data-n="108">Well, keep me company but two years more,</li>
  <li data-n="109">Thou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ANT.">
  <li data-n="110">Fare you well! I’ll grow a talker for this gear.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="GRA.">
  <li data-n="111">Thanks, i’ faith, for silence is only commendable</li>
  <li data-n="112">In a neat’s tongue dried and a maid not vendible.</li>

<ol data-s="ANT.">
  <li data-n="113">It is that—any thing now!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="BASS.">
  <li data-n="114">Gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing, more than any man in all Venice. His reasons are as two grains of wheat hid in two bushels of chaff; you shall seek all day ere you find them, and when you have them, they are not worth the search.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ANT.">
  <li data-n="115">Well, tell me now what lady is the same</li>
  <li data-n="116">To whom you swore a secret pilgrimage,</li>
  <li data-n="117">That you today promis’d to tell me of?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="BASS.">
  <li data-n="118">’Tis not unknown to you, Antonio,</li>
  <li data-n="119">How much I have disabled mine estate,</li>
  <li data-n="120">By something showing a more swelling port</li>
  <li data-n="121">Than my faint means would grant continuance.</li>
  <li data-n="122">Nor do I now make moan to be abridg’d</li>
  <li data-n="123">From such a noble rate, but my chief care</li>
  <li data-n="124">Is to come fairly off from the great debts</li>
  <li data-n="125">Wherein my time something too prodigal</li>
  <li data-n="126">Hath left me gag’d. To you, Antonio,</li>
  <li data-n="127">I owe the most in money and in love,</li>
  <li data-n="128">And from your love I have a warranty</li>
  <li data-n="129">To unburden all my plots and purposes</li>
  <li data-n="130">How to get clear of all the debts I owe.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ANT.">
  <li data-n="131">I pray you, good Bassanio, let me know it,</li>
  <li data-n="132">And if it stand, as you yourself still do,</li>
  <li data-n="133">Within the eye of honor, be assur’d</li>
  <li data-n="134">My purse, my person, my extremest means,</li>
  <li data-n="135">Lie all unlock’d to your occasions.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="BASS.">
  <li data-n="136">In my school-days, when I had lost one shaft,</li>
  <li data-n="137">I shot his fellow of the self-same flight</li>
  <li data-n="138">The self-same way with more advised watch</li>
  <li data-n="139">To find the other forth, and by adventuring both</li>
  <li data-n="140">I oft found both. I urge this childhood proof,</li>
  <li data-n="141">Because what follows is pure innocence.</li>
  <li data-n="142">I owe you much, and like a willful youth,</li>
  <li data-n="143">That which I owe is lost, but if you please</li>
  <li data-n="144">To shoot another arrow that self way</li>
  <li data-n="145">Which you did shoot the first, I do not doubt,</li>
  <li data-n="146">As I will watch the aim, or to find both</li>
  <li data-n="147">Or bring your latter hazard back again,</li>
  <li data-n="148">And thankfully rest debtor for the first.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ANT.">
  <li data-n="149">You know me well, and herein spend but time</li>
  <li data-n="150">To wind about my love with circumstance,</li>
  <li data-n="151">And out of doubt you do me now more wrong</li>
  <li data-n="152">In making question of my uttermost</li>
  <li data-n="153">Than if you had made waste of all I have.</li>
  <li data-n="154">Then do but say to me what I should do</li>
  <li data-n="155">That in your knowledge may by me be done,</li>
  <li data-n="156">And I am prest unto it; therefore speak.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="BASS.">
  <li data-n="157">In Belmont is a lady richly left,</li>
  <li data-n="158">And she is fair and, fairer than that word,</li>
  <li data-n="159">Of wondrous virtues. Sometimes from her eyes</li>
  <li data-n="160">I did receive fair speechless messages.</li>
  <li data-n="161">Her name is Portia, nothing undervalu’d</li>
  <li data-n="162">To Cato’s daughter, Brutus’ Portia.</li>
  <li data-n="163">Nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth,</li>
  <li data-n="164">For the four winds blow in from every coast</li>
  <li data-n="165">Renowned suitors, and her sunny locks</li>
  <li data-n="166">Hang on her temples like a golden fleece,</li>
  <li data-n="167">Which makes her seat of Belmont Colchis’ strond,</li>
  <li data-n="168">And many Jasons come in quest of her.</li>
  <li data-n="169">O my Antonio, had I but the means</li>
  <li data-n="170">To hold a rival place with one of them,</li>
  <li data-n="171">I have a mind presages me such thrift</li>
  <li data-n="172">That I should questionless be fortunate!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ANT.">
  <li data-n="173">Thou know’st that all my fortunes are at sea,</li>
  <li data-n="174">Neither have I money nor commodity</li>
  <li data-n="175">To raise a present sum; therefore go forth,</li>
  <li data-n="176">Try what my credit can in Venice do.</li>
  <li data-n="177">That shall be rack’d, even to the uttermost,</li>
  <li data-n="178">To furnish thee to Belmont, to fair Portia.</li>
  <li data-n="179">Go presently inquire, and so will I,</li>
  <li data-n="180">Where money is, and I no question make</li>
  <li data-n="181">To have it of my trust, or for my sake.</li>

<h3>Scene 2</h3>

<h4>Belmont. A room in Portia’s house.</h4>

<div class="stage-direction">
	Enter Portia with her waiting-woman, Nerissa.
	
		POR.
		NER.
	
</div>

<ol data-s="POR.">
  <li data-n="1">By my troth, Nerissa, my little body is a-weary of this great world.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="NER.">
  <li data-n="2">You would be, sweet madam, if your miseries were in the same abundance as your good fortunes are; and yet for aught I see, they are as sick that surfeit with too much as they that starve with nothing. It is no mean happiness therefore to be seated in the mean: superfluity comes sooner by white hairs, but competency lives longer.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="POR.">
  <li data-n="3">Good sentences, and well pronounc’d.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="NER.">
  <li data-n="4">They would be better if well follow’d.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="POR.">
  <li data-n="5">If to do were as easy as to know what were good to do, chapels had been churches, and poor men’s cottages princes’ palaces. It is a good divine that follows his own instructions; I can easier teach twenty what were good to be done, than to be one of the twenty to follow mine own teaching. The brain may devise laws for the blood, but a hot temper leaps o’er a cold decree—such a hare is madness the youth, to skip o’er the meshes of good counsel the cripple. But this reasoning is not in the fashion to choose me a husband. O me, the word choose! I may neither choose who I would, nor refuse who I dislike; so is the will of a living daughter curb’d by the will of a dead father. Is it not hard, Nerissa, that I cannot choose one, nor refuse none?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="NER.">
  <li data-n="6">Your father was ever virtuous, and holy men at their death have good inspirations; therefore the lott’ry that he hath devis’d 
in these three chests of gold, silver, and lead, whereof who chooses his meaning chooses you, will no doubt never be chosen by any rightly but one who you shall rightly love. 
But what warmth is there in your affection towards any of these princely suitors that are already come?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="POR.">
  <li data-n="7">I pray thee over-name them, and as thou namest them, I will describe them; and according to my description level at my affection.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="NER.">
  <li data-n="8">First, there is the Neapolitan prince.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="POR.">
  <li data-n="9">Ay, that’s a colt indeed, for he doth nothing but talk of his horse, and he makes it a great appropriation to his own good parts 
that he can shoe him himself. I am much afeard my lady his mother play’d false with a smith.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="NER.">
  <li data-n="10">Then is there the County Palentine.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="POR.">
  <li data-n="11">He doth nothing but frown, as who should say, “And you will not have me, choose.” He hears merry tales and smiles not. 
I fear he will prove the weeping philosopher when he grows old, being so full of unmannerly sadness in his youth. 
I had rather be married to a death’s-head with a bone in his mouth than to either of these. God defend me from these two!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="NER.">
  <li data-n="12">How say you by the French lord, <foreign xml:lang="fr">Monsieur</foreign> Le Bon?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="POR.">
  <li data-n="13">God made him, and therefore let him pass for a man. In truth, I know it is a sin to be a mocker, but he! Why, he hath a horse better than the Neapolitan’s, a better bad habit of frowning than the Count Palentine; he is every man in no man. If a throstle sing, he falls straight a-cap’ring. He will fence with his own shadow. If I should marry him, I should marry twenty husbands. If he would despise me, I would forgive him, for if he love me to madness, I shall never requite him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="NER.">
  <li data-n="14">What say you then to Falconbridge, the young baron of England?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="POR.">
  <li data-n="15">You know I say nothing to him, for he understands not me, nor I him. He hath neither Latin, French, nor Italian, and you will come into the court and swear that I have a poor pennyworth in the English. He is a proper man’s picture, but alas, who can converse with a dumb show? How oddly he is suited! I think he bought his doublet in Italy, his round hose in France, his bonnet in Germany, and his behavior every where.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="NER.">
  <li data-n="16">What think you of the Scottish lord, his neighbor?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="POR.">
  <li data-n="17">That he hath a neighborly charity in him, for he borrow’d a box of the ear of the Englishman, and swore he would pay him again when he was able. I think the Frenchman became his surety and seal’d under for another.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="NER.">
  <li data-n="18">How like you the young German, the Duke of Saxony’s nephew?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="POR.">
  <li data-n="19">Very vildly in the morning, when he is sober, and most vildly in the afternoon, when he is drunk. When he is best, he is a little worse than a man, and when he is worst, he is little better than a beast. And the worst fall that ever fell, I hope I shall make shift to go without him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="NER.">
  <li data-n="20">If he should offer to choose, and choose the right casket, you should refuse to perform your father’s will, if you should refuse to accept him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="POR.">
  <li data-n="21">Therefore for fear of the worst, I pray thee set a deep glass of Rhenish wine on the contrary casket, for if the devil be within, and that temptation without, I know he will choose it. I will do any thing, Nerissa, ere I will be married to a sponge.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="NER.">
  <li data-n="22">You need not fear, lady, the having any of these lords. They have acquainted me with their determinations, which is indeed to return to their home, and to trouble you with no more suit, unless you may be won by some other sort than your father’s imposition depending on the caskets.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="POR.">
  <li data-n="23">If I live to be as old as Sibylla, I will die as chaste as Diana, unless I be obtain’d by the manner of my father’s will. 
I am glad this parcel of wooers are so reasonable, for there is not one among them but I dote on his very absence, and I pray God grant them a fair departure.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="NER.">
  <li data-n="24">Do you not remember, lady, in your father’s time, a Venetian, a scholar and a soldier, that came hither in company of the Marquis of Montferrat?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="POR.">
  <li data-n="25">Yes, yes, it was Bassanio—as I think, so was he call’d.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="NER.">
  <li data-n="26">True, madam; he, of all the men that ever my foolish eyes look’d upon, was the best deserving a fair lady.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="POR.">
  <li data-n="27">I remember him well, and I remember him worthy of thy praise.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">
	Enter a Servingman.
	
		SERV.
	
</li>
  <li data-n="28">How now, what news?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="SERV.">
  <li data-n="29">The four strangers seek for you, madam, to take their leave; and there is a forerunner come from a fift, the Prince of Morocco, who brings word the Prince his master will be here tonight.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="POR.">
  <li data-n="30">If I could bid the fifth welcome with so good heart as I can bid the other four farewell, I should be glad of his approach. If he have the condition of a saint, and the complexion of a devil, I had rather he should shrive me than wive me.</li>
  <li data-n="31">Come, Nerissa. Sirrah, go before.</li>
  <li data-n="32">Whiles we shut the gate upon one wooer, another knocks at the door.</li>

<ol data-s="SHY.">
  <li data-n="11">Ho, no, no, no, no! My meaning in saying he is a good man is to have you understand me that he is sufficient. Yet his means are in supposition: he hath an argosy bound to Tripolis, another to the Indies; I understand moreover upon the Rialto, he hath a third at Mexico, a fourth for England, and other ventures he hath, squand’red abroad. But ships are but boards, sailors but men; there be land-rats and water-rats, water-thieves and land-thieves, I mean pirates, and then there is the peril of waters, winds, and rocks. The man is notwithstanding sufficient. Three thousand ducats; I think I may take his bond.</li>

<h4>Venice. A street.</h4>

<div class="stage-direction">
	Enter the Clown Launcelot Gobbo alone.
	
		LAUN.
	
</div>

<ol data-s="LAUN.">
  <li data-n="1">Certainly my conscience will serve me to run from this Jew my master. 
The fiend is at mine elbow and tempts me, saying to me, “Gobbo, Launcelot Gobbo, good Launcelot,” or “good Gobbo,” 
or “good Launcelot Gobbo, use your legs, take the start, run away.” My conscience says, “No; take heed, honest Launcelot, take heed, honest Gobbo,” 
or as aforesaid, “honest Launcelot Gobbo, do not run, scorn running with thy heels.” 
Well, the most courageous fiend bids me pack. “Fia!” says the fiend; “away!” says the fiend; “for the heavens, rouse up a brave mind,” says the fiend, “and run.” Well, my conscience, hanging about the neck of my heart, says very wisely to me, “My honest friend Launcelot, being an honest man’s son”—or rather an honest woman’s son, for indeed my father did something smack, something grow to, he had a kind of taste—well, my conscience says, “Launcelot, bouge not.” “Bouge,” says the fiend. “Bouge not,” says my conscience. “Conscience,” say I, “you counsel well.” “Fiend,” say I, “you counsel well.” To be rul’d by my conscience, I should stay with the Jew my master, who (God bless the mark) is a kind of devil; and to run away from the Jew, I should be rul’d by the fiend, who, saving your reverence, is the devil himself. Certainly the Jew is the very devil incarnation, and in my conscience, my conscience is but a kind of hard conscience, to offer to counsel me to stay with the Jew. The fiend gives the more friendly counsel: I will run, fiend; my heels are at your commandment, I will run.</li>

I am famish’d in his service; you may tell every finger I have with my ribs. Father, I am glad you are come; give me your present to one Master Bassanio, who indeed gives rare new liveries.

  <li data-n="13">Some god direct my judgment! Let me see,</li>

  <li data-n="15">What says this leaden casket?</li>

  <li data-n="50">To think so base a thought; it were too gross</li>
  <li data-n="51">To rib her cerecloth in the obscure grave.</li>
  <li data-n="52">Or shall I think in silver she’s immur’d,</li>

  <li data-n="54">O sinful thought! Never so rich a gem</li>

  <li data-n="1">Now what news on the Rialto?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="SAL.">
  <li data-n="2">Why, yet it lives there uncheck’d that Antonio hath a ship of rich lading wrack’d on the Narrow Seas; the Goodwins I think they call the place, a very dangerous flat, and fatal, where the carcasses of many a tall ship lie buried, as they say, if my gossip Report be an honest woman of her word.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="SOL.">
  <li data-n="3">I would she were as lying a gossip in that as ever knapp’d ginger or made her neighbors believe she wept for the death of a third husband. But it is true, without any slips of prolixity, or crossing the plain highway of talk, that the good Antonio, the honest Antonio—O that I had a title good enough to keep his name company!—</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="SAL.">
  <li data-n="4">Come, the full stop.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="SOL.">
  <li data-n="5">Ha, what sayest thou? Why, the end is, he hath lost a ship.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="SAL.">
  <li data-n="6">I would it might prove the end of his losses.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="SOL.">

  <li data-n="9">You knew, none so well, none so well as you, of my daughter’s flight.</li>

  <li data-n="10">That’s certain. I for my part knew the tailor that made the wings she flew withal.</li>

<ol data-s="SOL.">

<ol data-s="SHY.">
  <li data-n="12">She is damn’d for it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="SAL.">

<ol data-s="SHY.">
  <li data-n="16">I say, my daughter is my flesh and my blood.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="SAL.">
  <li data-n="17">There is more difference between thy flesh and hers than between jet and ivory, more between your 
bloods than there is between red wine and Rhenish. But tell us, do you hear whether Antonio have had any loss at sea or no?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="SHY.">
  <li data-n="18">There I have another bad match. A bank-rout, a prodigal, who dare scarce show his head on the Rialto; a beggar, that was us’d to come so smug upon the mart: let him look to his bond. He was wont to call me usurer, let him look to his bond. He was wont to lend money for a Christian
 cur’sy, let him look to his bond.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="SAL.">
  <li data-n="19">Why, I am sure if he forfeit thou wilt not take his flesh. What’s that good for?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="SHY.">
  <li data-n="20">To bait fish withal—if it will feed nothing else, it will feed my revenge. He hath disgrac’d me, and hind’red me half a million, laugh’d at my losses, mock’d at my gains, scorn’d my nation, thwarted my bargains, cool’d my friends, heated mine enemies; and what’s his reason? I am a Jew. Hath not a Jew eyes? Hath not a Jew hands, organs, dimensions, senses, affections, passions; fed with the same food, hurt with the same weapons, subject to the same diseases, heal’d by the same means, warm’d and cool’d by the same winter and summer, as a Christian is? If you prick us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh? If you poison us, do we not die? And if you wrong us, shall we not revenge? If we are like you in the rest, we will resemble you in that. If a Jew wrong a Christian, what is his humility? Revenge. If a Christian wrong a Jew, what should his sufferance be by Christian example? Why, revenge. The villainy you teach me, I will execute, and it shall go hard but I will better the instruction.</li>

  <li data-n="35">There came divers of Antonio’s creditors in my company to Venice that swear he cannot choose but break.</li>

<ol data-s="SHY.">
  <li data-n="36">I am very glad of it. I’ll plague him, I’ll torture him. I am glad of it.</li>

  <li data-n="144">Giddy in spirit, still gazing in a doubt</li>
  <li data-n="145">Whether those peals of praise be his or no,</li>
  <li data-n="146">So, thrice-fair lady, stand I, even so,</li>
  <li data-n="147">As doubtful whether what I see be true,</li>

<ol data-s="POR.">
  <li data-n="149">You see me, Lord Bassanio, where I stand,</li>
  <li data-n="150">Such as I am. Though for myself alone</li>
  <li data-n="151">I would not be ambitious in my wish</li>
  <li data-n="152">To wish myself much better, yet for you,</li>
  <li data-n="153">I would be trebled twenty times myself,</li>
  <li data-n="154">A thousand times more fair, ten thousand times more rich,</li>
  <li data-n="155">That only to stand high in your account,</li>
  <li data-n="156">I might in virtues, beauties, livings, friends,</li>
  <li data-n="157">Exceed account. But the full sum of me</li>
  <li data-n="158">Is sum of something; which, to term in gross,</li>
  <li data-n="159">Is an unlesson’d girl, unschool’d, unpractic’d,</li>
  <li data-n="160">Happy in this, she is not yet so old</li>
  <li data-n="161">But she may learn; happier than this,</li>
  <li data-n="162">She is not bred so dull but she can learn;</li>
  <li data-n="163">Happiest of all, is that her gentle spirit</li>
  <li data-n="164">Commits itself to yours to be directed,</li>
  <li data-n="165">As from her lord, her governor, her king.</li>
  <li data-n="166">Myself, and what is mine, to you and yours</li>
  <li data-n="167">Is now converted. But now I was the lord</li>
  <li data-n="168">Of this fair mansion, master of my servants,</li>
  <li data-n="169">Queen o’er myself; and even now, but now,</li>
  <li data-n="170">This house, these servants, and this same myself</li>
  <li data-n="171">Are yours—my lord’s!—I give them with this ring,</li>
  <li data-n="172">Which when you part from, lose, or give away,</li>
  <li data-n="173">Let it presage the ruin of your love,</li>
  <li data-n="174">And be my vantage to exclaim on you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="BASS.">
  <li data-n="175">Madam, you have bereft me of all words,</li>
  <li data-n="176">Only my blood speaks to you in my veins,</li>
  <li data-n="177">And there is such confusion in my powers,</li>
  <li data-n="178">As after some oration fairly spoke</li>
  <li data-n="179">By a beloved prince, there doth appear</li>
  <li data-n="180">Among the buzzing pleased multitude,</li>
  <li data-n="181">Where every something, being blent together,</li>
  <li data-n="182">Turns to a wild of nothing, save of joy</li>
  <li data-n="183">Express’d and not express’d. But when this ring</li>
  <li data-n="184">Parts from this finger, then parts life from hence;</li>

<ol data-s="BASS.">
  <li data-n="248" data-o="7">O sweet Portia,</li>
  <li data-n="249">Here are a few of the unpleasant’st words</li>
  <li data-n="250">That ever blotted paper! Gentle lady,</li>
  <li data-n="251">When I did first impart my love to you,</li>
  <li data-n="252">I freely told you all the wealth I had</li>
  <li data-n="253">Ran in my veins: I was a gentleman;</li>
  <li data-n="254">And then I told you true. And yet, dear lady,</li>
  <li data-n="255">Rating myself at nothing, you shall see</li>
  <li data-n="256">How much I was a braggart: when I told you</li>
  <li data-n="257">My state was nothing, I should then have told you</li>
  <li data-n="258">That I was worse than nothing; for indeed</li>
  <li data-n="259">I have engag’d myself to a dear friend,</li>
  <li data-n="260">Engag’d my friend to his mere enemy,</li>
  <li data-n="261">To feed my means. Here is a letter, lady,</li>
  <li data-n="262">The paper as the body of my friend,</li>
  <li data-n="263">And every word in it a gaping wound</li>
  <li data-n="264">Issuing life-blood. But is it true, Salerio?</li>
  <li data-n="265">Hath all his ventures fail’d? What, not one hit?</li>
  <li data-n="266">From Tripolis, from Mexico, and England,</li>
  <li data-n="267">From Lisbon, Barbary, and India,</li>
  <li data-n="268">And not one vessel scape the dreadful touch</li>
  <li data-n="269">Of merchant-marring rocks?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="SAL.">
  <li data-n="269" data-o="6">Not one, my lord.</li>
  <li data-n="270">Besides, it should appear, that if he had</li>
  <li data-n="271">The present money to discharge the Jew,</li>
  <li data-n="272">He would not take it. Never did I know</li>
  <li data-n="273">A creature that did bear the shape of man</li>
  <li data-n="274">So keen and greedy to confound a man.</li>
  <li data-n="275">He plies the Duke at morning and at night,</li>
  <li data-n="276">And doth impeach the freedom of the state,</li>
  <li data-n="277">If they deny him justice. Twenty merchants,</li>
  <li data-n="278">The Duke himself, and the magnificoes</li>
  <li data-n="279">Of greatest port, have all persuaded with him,</li>
  <li data-n="280">But none can drive him from the envious plea</li>
  <li data-n="281">Of forfeiture, of justice, and his bond.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="JES.">
  <li data-n="282">When I was with him I have heard him swear</li>

<ol data-s="LAUN.">
  <li data-n="1">Yes, truly, for look you, the sins of the father are to be laid upon the children; therefore, I promise you, I fear you. 
I was always plain with you, and so now I speak my agitation of the matter; therefore be a’ good cheer, for truly I think you are damn’d. 
There is but one hope in it that can do you any good, and that is but a kind of bastard hope neither.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="JES.">
  <li data-n="2">And what hope is that, I pray thee?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="LAUN.">
  <li data-n="3">Marry, you may partly hope that your father got you not, that you are not the Jew’s daughter.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="JES.">
  <li data-n="4">That were a kind of bastard hope indeed; so the sins of my mother should be visited upon me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="LAUN.">
  <li data-n="5">Truly then I fear you are damn’d both by father and mother; thus when I shun Scylla, your father, I fall into Charybdis, your mother. 
Well, you are gone both ways.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="JES.">
  <li data-n="6">I shall be sav’d by my husband, he hath made me a Christian!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="LAUN.">
  <li data-n="7">Truly, the more to blame he; we were Christians enow before, e’en as many as could well live one by another. 
This making of Christians will raise the price of hogs. If we grow all to be pork-eaters, we shall not shortly have a rasher on the coals for money.</li>

</ol>

<ol data-s="JES.">
  <li data-n="10">Nay, you need not fear us, Lorenzo, Launcelot and I are out. He tells me flatly there’s no mercy for me in heaven because I am a Jew’s daughter; 
and he says you are no good member of the commonwealth, for in converting Jews to Christians, you raise the price of pork.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="LOR.">
  <li data-n="11">I shall answer that better to the commonwealth than you can the getting up of the Negro’s belly; the Moor is with child by you, Launcelot.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="LAUN.">
  <li data-n="12">It is much that the Moor should be more than reason; but if she be less than an honest woman, she is indeed more than I took her for.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="LOR.">
  <li data-n="13">How every fool can play upon the word! I think the best grace of wit will shortly turn into silence, and discourse grow commendable in none only but parrots. Go in, sirrah, bid them prepare for dinner.</li>

<ol data-s="LAUN.">
  <li data-n="14">That is done, sir, they have all stomachs!</li>

<ol data-s="LOR.">
  <li data-n="17">Will you cover then, sir?</li>

<ol data-s="LOR.">
  <li data-n="19">Yet more quarreling with occasion! Wilt thou show the whole wealth of thy wit in an instant? I pray thee understand a plain man in his plain meaning: go to thy fellows, bid them cover the table, serve in the meat, and we will come in to dinner.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="LAUN.">

He is furnish’d with my opinion, which better’d with his own learning, the greatness whereof I cannot enough commend, comes with him, at my importunity, to fill up your Grace’s request in my stead.

  <li data-n="171">It blesseth him that gives and him that takes.</li>
  <li data-n="172">’Tis mightiest in the mightiest, it becomes</li>
  <li data-n="173">The throned monarch better than his crown.</li>
  <li data-n="174">His sceptre shows the force of temporal power,</li>
  <li data-n="175">The attribute to awe and majesty,</li>
  <li data-n="176">Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;</li>

  <li data-n="178">It is enthroned in the hearts of kings,</li>
  <li data-n="179">It is an attribute to God himself;</li>

  <li data-n="181">When mercy seasons justice. Therefore, Jew,</li>
  <li data-n="182">Though justice be thy plea, consider this,</li>
  <li data-n="183">That in the course of justice, none of us</li>

  <li data-n="163">You were to blame, I must be plain with you,</li>
  <li data-n="164">To part so slightly with your wive’s first gift,</li>
  <li data-n="165">A thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger,</li>
  <li data-n="166">And so riveted with faith unto your flesh.</li>
  <li data-n="167">I gave my love a ring, and made him swear</li>
  <li data-n="168">Never to part with it, and here he stands.</li>
  <li data-n="169">I dare be sworn for him he would not leave it,</li>
  <li data-n="170">Nor pluck it from his finger, for the wealth</li>
  <li data-n="171">That the world masters. Now, in faith, Gratiano,</li>
  <li data-n="172">You give your wife too unkind a cause of grief;</li>
  <li data-n="173">And ’twere to me I should be mad at it.</li>

</li>
  <li data-n="174">Why, I were best to cut my left hand off,</li>
  <li data-n="175">And swear I lost the ring defending it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="GRA.">
  <li data-n="176">My Lord Bassanio gave his ring away</li>
  <li data-n="177">Unto the judge that begg’d it, and indeed</li>
  <li data-n="178">Deserv’d it too; and then the boy, his clerk,</li>
  <li data-n="179">That took some pains in writing, he begg’d mine,</li>
  <li data-n="180">And neither man nor master would take aught</li>
  <li data-n="181">But the two rings.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="POR.">
  <li data-n="181" data-o="4">What ring gave you, my lord?</li>
  <li data-n="182">Not that, I hope, which you receiv’d of me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="BASS.">
  <li data-n="183">If I could add a lie unto a fault,</li>
  <li data-n="184">I would deny it; but you see my finger</li>
  <li data-n="185">Hath not the ring upon it, it is gone.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="POR.">
  <li data-n="186">Even so void is your false heart of truth.</li>
  <li data-n="187">By heaven, I will ne’er come in your bed</li>
  <li data-n="188">Until I see the ring!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="NER.">
  <li data-n="188" data-o="4">Nor I in yours</li>
  <li data-n="189">Till I again see mine!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="BASS.">
  <li data-n="189" data-o="4">Sweet Portia,</li>
  <li data-n="190">If you did know to whom I gave the ring,</li>
  <li data-n="191">If you did know for whom I gave the ring,</li>
  <li data-n="192">And would conceive for what I gave the ring,</li>
  <li data-n="193">And how unwillingly I left the ring,</li>
  <li data-n="194">When nought would be accepted but the ring,</li>
  <li data-n="195">You would abate the strength of your displeasure.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="POR.">
  <li data-n="196">If you had known the virtue of the ring,</li>
  <li data-n="197">Or half her worthiness that gave the ring,</li>
  <li data-n="198">Or your own honor to contain the ring,</li>
  <li data-n="199">You would not then have parted with the ring.</li>
  <li data-n="200">What man is there so much unreasonable,</li>
  <li data-n="201">If you had pleas’d to have defended it</li>
  <li data-n="202">With any terms of zeal, wanted the modesty</li>
  <li data-n="203">To urge the thing held as a ceremony?</li>
  <li data-n="204">Nerissa teaches me what to believe—</li>
  <li data-n="205">I’ll die for’t but some woman had the ring!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="BASS.">
  <li data-n="206">No, by my honor, madam, by my soul,</li>
  <li data-n="207">No woman had it, but a civil doctor,</li>
  <li data-n="208">Which did refuse three thousand ducats of me,</li>
  <li data-n="209">And begg’d the ring, the which I did deny him,</li>
  <li data-n="210">And suffer’d him to go displeas’d away—</li>
  <li data-n="211">Even he that had held up the very life</li>
  <li data-n="212">Of my dear friend. What should I say, sweet lady?</li>
  <li data-n="213">I was enforc’d to send it after him,</li>
  <li data-n="214">I was beset with shame and courtesy,</li>
  <li data-n="215">My honor would not let ingratitude</li>
  <li data-n="216">So much besmear it. Pardon me, good lady,</li>
  <li data-n="217">For by these blessed candles of the night,</li>
  <li data-n="218">Had you been there, I think you would have begg’d</li>
  <li data-n="219">The ring of me to give the worthy doctor.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="POR.">
  <li data-n="220">Let not that doctor e’er come near my house.</li>
  <li data-n="221">Since he hath got the jewel that I loved,</li>
  <li data-n="222">And that which you did swear to keep for me,</li>
  <li data-n="223">I will become as liberal as you,</li>
  <li data-n="224">I’ll not deny him any thing I have,</li>
  <li data-n="225">No, not my body nor my husband’s bed.</li>
  <li data-n="226">Know him I shall, I am well sure of it.</li>
  <li data-n="227">Lie not a night from home. Watch me like Argus;</li>
  <li data-n="228">If you do not, if I be left alone,</li>
  <li data-n="229">Now by mine honor, which is yet mine own,</li>
  <li data-n="230">I’ll have that doctor for my bedfellow.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="NER.">
  <li data-n="231">And I his clerk; therefore be well advis’d</li>
  <li data-n="232">How you do leave me to mine own protection.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="GRA.">
  <li data-n="233">Well, do you so; let not me take him then,</li>
  <li data-n="234">For if I do, I’ll mar the young clerk’s pen.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ANT.">
  <li data-n="235">I am th’ unhappy subject of these quarrels.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="POR.">
  <li data-n="236">Sir, grieve not you, you are welcome notwithstanding.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="BASS.">
  <li data-n="237">Portia, forgive me this enforced wrong,</li>
  <li data-n="238">And in the hearing of these many friends</li>
  <li data-n="239">I swear to thee, even by thine own fair eyes,</li>
  <li data-n="240">Wherein I see myself—</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="POR.">
  <li data-n="240" data-o="5">Mark you but that!</li>
  <li data-n="241">In both my eyes he doubly sees himself,</li>
  <li data-n="242">In each eye, one. Swear by your double self,</li>
  <li data-n="243">And there’s an oath of credit.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="BASS.">
  <li data-n="243" data-o="6">Nay, but hear me.</li>
  <li data-n="244">Pardon this fault, and by my soul I swear</li>
  <li data-n="245">I never more will break an oath with thee.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ANT.">
  <li data-n="246">I once did lend my body for his wealth,</li>
  <li data-n="247">Which but for him that had your husband’s ring</li>
  <li data-n="248">Had quite miscarried. I dare be bound again,</li>
  <li data-n="249">My soul upon the forfeit, that your lord</li>
  <li data-n="250">Will never more break faith advisedly.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="POR.">
  <li data-n="251">Then you shall be his surety. Give him this,</li>
  <li data-n="252">And bid him keep it better than the other.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ANT.">
  <li data-n="253">Here, Lord Bassanio, swear to keep this ring.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="BASS.">
  <li data-n="254">By heaven, it is the same I gave the doctor!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="POR.">
  <li data-n="255">I had it of him. Pardon me, Bassanio,</li>
  <li data-n="256">For by this ring, the doctor lay with me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="NER.">
  <li data-n="257">And pardon me, my gentle Gratiano,</li>
  <li data-n="258">For that same scrubbed boy, the doctor’s clerk,</li>
  <li data-n="259">In lieu of this last night did lie with me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="GRA.">
  <li data-n="260">Why, this is like the mending of highways</li>
  <li data-n="261">In summer, where the ways are fair enough.</li>
  <li data-n="262">What, are we cuckolds ere we have deserv’d it?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="POR.">
  <li data-n="263">Speak not so grossly, you are all amaz’d.</li>
  <li data-n="264">Here is a letter, read it at your leisure.</li>
  <li data-n="265">It comes from Padua, from Bellario.</li>
  <li data-n="266">There you shall find that Portia was the doctor,</li>
  <li data-n="267">Nerissa there her clerk. Lorenzo here</li>
  <li data-n="268">Shall witness I set forth as soon as you,</li>
  <li data-n="269">And even but now return’d; I have not yet</li>
  <li data-n="270">Enter’d my house. Antonio, you are welcome,</li>
  <li data-n="271">And I have better news in store for you</li>
  <li data-n="272">Than you expect. Unseal this letter soon;</li>
  <li data-n="273">There you shall find three of your argosies</li>
  <li data-n="274">Are richly come to harbor suddenly.</li>
  <li data-n="275">You shall not know by what strange accident</li>
  <li data-n="276">I chanced on this letter.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ANT.">
  <li data-n="276" data-o="5">I am dumb.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="BASS.">
  <li data-n="277">Were you the doctor, and I knew you not?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="GRA.">
  <li data-n="278">Were you the clerk that is to make me cuckold?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="NER.">
  <li data-n="279">Ay, but the clerk that never means to do it,</li>
  <li data-n="280">Unless he live until he be a man.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="BASS.">
  <li data-n="281">Sweet doctor, you shall be my bedfellow—</li>
  <li data-n="282">When I am absent, then lie with my wife.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="ANT.">
  <li data-n="283">Sweet lady, you have given me life and living,</li>
  <li data-n="284">For here I read for certain that my ships</li>
  <li data-n="285">Are safely come to road.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="POR.">
  <li data-n="285" data-o="5">How now, Lorenzo?</li>
  <li data-n="286">My clerk hath some good comforts too for you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="NER.">
  <li data-n="287">Ay, and I’ll give them him without a fee.</li>
  <li data-n="288">There do I give to you and Jessica,</li>
  <li data-n="289">From the rich Jew, a special deed of gift,</li>
  <li data-n="290">After his death, of all he dies possess’d of.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="LOR.">
  <li data-n="291">Fair ladies, you drop manna in the way</li>
  <li data-n="292">Of starved people.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="POR.">
  <li data-n="292" data-o="4">It is almost morning,</li>
  <li data-n="293">And yet I am sure you are not satisfied</li>
  <li data-n="294">Of these events at full. Let us go in,</li>
  <li data-n="295">And charge us there upon inter’gatories,</li>
  <li data-n="296">And we will answer all things faithfully.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-s="GRA.">
  <li data-n="297">Let it be so. The first inter’gatory</li>
  <li data-n="298">That my Nerissa shall be sworn on is,</li>
  <li data-n="299">Whether till the next night she had rather stay,</li>
  <li data-n="300">Or go to bed now, being two hours to day.</li>
  <li data-n="301">But were the day come, I should wish it dark</li>
  <li data-n="302">Till I were couching with the doctor’s clerk.</li>
  <li data-n="303">Well, while I live I’ll fear no other thing</li>
  <li data-n="304">So sore, as keeping safe Nerissa’s ring.</li>
