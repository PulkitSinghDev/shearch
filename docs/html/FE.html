<h1 id="title">A Funeral Elegy</h1>

<section id="poemintro">
TO MASTER JOHN PETER<br>of Bowhay in Devon, Esq.<br>The love I bore to your brother, and will do to his memory, hath crav'd from me this last duty of a friend; I am herein but a second to the privilege of Truth, who can warrant more in his behalf than I undertook to deliver. Exercise in this kind I will little affect, and am less addicted to, but there must be miracle in that labor which, to witness my remembrance to this departed gentleman, I would not willingly undergo. Yet whatsoever is here done, is done to him, and to him only. For whom and whose sake I will not forget to remember any friendly respects to you, or to any of those that have lov'd him for himself, and himself for his deserts.<br>W. S.

<section class="stanza">
  <p data-n="2">Since Time, and his predestinated end,</p>
  <p data-n="3">Abridg’d the circuit of his hopeful days,</p>
  <p data-n="4">Whiles both his Youth and Virtue did intend</p>
  <p data-n="5">The good endeavors of deserving praise,</p>
  <p data-n="6">What memorable monument can last</p>
  <p data-n="7">Whereon to build his never-blemish’d name</p>
  <p data-n="8">But his own worth, wherein his life was grac’d—</p>
  <p data-n="9">Sith as [that] ever he maintain’d the same?</p>
  <p data-n="10">Oblivion in the darkest day to come,</p>
  <p data-n="11">When sin shall tread on merit in the dust,</p>
  <p data-n="12">Cannot rase out the lamentable tomb</p>
  <p data-n="13">Of his short-liv’d deserts; but still they must,</p>
  <p data-n="14">Even in the hearts and memories of men,</p>
  <p data-n="15">Claim fit Respect, that they, in every limb</p>
  <p data-n="16">Rememb’ring what he was, with comfort then</p>
  <p data-n="17">May pattern out one truly good, by him.</p>
  <p data-n="18">For he was truly good, if honest care</p>
  <p data-n="19">Of harmless conversation may commend</p>
  <p data-n="20">A life free from such stains as follies are,</p>
  <p data-n="21">Ill recompensed only in his end.</p>
  <p data-n="22">Nor can the tongue of him who lov’d him least</p>
  <p data-n="23">(If there can be minority of love</p>
  <p data-n="24">To one superlative above the rest</p>
  <p data-n="25">Of many men in steady faith) reprove</p>
  <p data-n="26">His constant temper, in the equal weight</p>
  <p data-n="27">Of thankfulness and kindness: Truth doth leave</p>
  <p data-n="28">Sufficient proof, he was in every right</p>
  <p data-n="29">As kind to give, as thankful to receive.</p>
  <p data-n="30">The curious eye of a quick-brain’d survey</p>
  <p data-n="31">Could scantly find a mote amidst the sun</p>
  <p data-n="32">Of his too-short’ned days, or make a prey</p>
  <p data-n="33">Of any faulty errors he had done—</p>
  <p data-n="34">Not that he was above the spleenful sense</p>
  <p data-n="35">And spite of malice, but for that he had</p>
  <p data-n="36">Warrant enough in his own innocence</p>
  <p data-n="37">Against the sting of some in nature bad.</p>
  <p data-n="38">Yet who is he so absolutely blest</p>
  <p data-n="39">That lives encompass’d in a mortal frame,</p>
  <p data-n="40">Sometime in reputation not oppress’d</p>
  <p data-n="41">By some in nothing famous but defame?</p>
  <p data-n="42">Such in the By-path and the Ridgeway lurk</p>
  <p data-n="43">That leads to ruin, in a smooth pretense</p>
  <p data-n="44">Of what they do to be a special work</p>
  <p data-n="45">Of singleness, not tending to offense;</p>
  <p data-n="46">Whose very virtues are, not to detract</p>
  <p data-n="47">Whiles hope remains of gain (base fee of slaves),</p>
  <p data-n="48">Despising chiefly men in fortunes wrack’d—</p>
  <p data-n="49">But death to such gives unrememb’red graves.</p>
  <p data-n="50">Now therein liv’d he happy, if to be</p>
  <p data-n="51">Free from detraction happiness it be.</p>
  <p data-n="52">His younger years gave comfortable hope</p>
  <p data-n="53">To hope for comfort in his riper youth,</p>
  <p data-n="54">Which, harvest-like, did yield again the crop</p>
  <p data-n="55">Of Education, better’d in his truth.</p>
  <p data-n="56">Those noble twins of heaven-infused races,</p>
  <p data-n="57">Learning and Wit, refined in their kind</p>
  <p data-n="58">Did jointly both, in their peculiar graces,</p>
  <p data-n="59">Enrich the curious temple of his mind;</p>
  <p data-n="60">Indeed a temple, in whose precious white</p>
  <p data-n="61">Sat Reason by Religion oversway’d,</p>
  <p data-n="62">Teaching his other senses, with delight,</p>
  <p data-n="63">How Piety and Zeal should be obey’d—</p>
  <p data-n="64">Not fruitlessly in prodigal expense</p>
  <p data-n="65">Wasting his best of time, but so content</p>
  <p data-n="66">With Reason’s golden Mean to make defense</p>
  <p data-n="67">Against the assault of youth’s encouragement;</p>
  <p data-n="68">As not the tide of this surrounding age</p>
  <p data-n="69">(When now his father’s death had freed his will)</p>
  <p data-n="70">Could make him subject to the drunken rage</p>
  <p data-n="71">Of such whose only glory is their ill.</p>
  <p data-n="72">He from the happy knowledge of the wise</p>
  <p data-n="73">Draws virtue to reprove secured fools</p>
  <p data-n="74">And shuns the glad sleights of ensnaring vice</p>
  <p data-n="75">To spend his spring of days in sacred schools.</p>
  <p data-n="76">Here gave he diet to the sick desires</p>
  <p data-n="77">That day by day assault the weaker man,</p>
  <p data-n="78">And with fit moderation still retires</p>
  <p data-n="79">From what doth batter virtue now and then.</p>
  <p data-n="80">But that I not intend in full discourse</p>
  <p data-n="81">To progress out his life, I could display</p>
  <p data-n="82">A good man in each part exact and force</p>
  <p data-n="83">The common voice to warrant what I say.</p>
  <p data-n="84">For if his fate and heaven had decreed</p>
  <p data-n="85">That full of days he might have liv’d to see</p>
  <p data-n="86">The grave in peace, the times that should succeed</p>
  <p data-n="87">Had been best-speaking witnesses with me;</p>
  <p data-n="88">Whose conversation so untouch’d did move</p>
  <p data-n="89">Respect most in itself, as who would scan</p>
  <p data-n="90">His honesty and worth, by them might prove</p>
  <p data-n="91">He was a kind, true, perfect gentleman—</p>
  <p data-n="92">Not in the outside of disgraceful folly,</p>
  <p data-n="93">Courting opinion with unfit disguise,</p>
  <p data-n="94">Affecting fashions, nor addicted wholly</p>
  <p data-n="95">To unbeseeming blushless vanities,</p>
  <p data-n="96">But suiting so his habit and desire</p>
  <p data-n="97">As that his Virtue was his best Attire.</p>
  <p data-n="98">Not in the waste of many idle words</p>
  <p data-n="99">Car’d he to be heard talk, nor in the float</p>
  <p data-n="100">Of fond conceit, such as this age affords,</p>
  <p data-n="101">By vain discourse upon himself to dote;</p>
  <p data-n="102">For his becoming silence gave such grace</p>
  <p data-n="103">To his judicious parts, as what he spake</p>
  <p data-n="104">Seem’d rather answers which the wise embrace</p>
  <p data-n="105">Than busy questions such as talkers make.</p>
  <p data-n="106">And though his qualities might well deserve</p>
  <p data-n="107">Just commendation, yet his furnish’d mind</p>
  <p data-n="108">Such harmony of goodness did preserve</p>
  <p data-n="109">As nature never built in better kind;</p>
  <p data-n="110">Knowing the best, and therefore not presuming</p>
  <p data-n="111">In knowing, but for that it was the best,</p>
  <p data-n="112">Ever within himself free choice resuming</p>
  <p data-n="113">Of true perfection, in a perfect breast;</p>
  <p data-n="114">So that his mind and body made an inn,</p>
  <p data-n="115">The one to lodge the other, both like fram’d</p>
  <p data-n="116">For fair conditions, guests that soonest win</p>
  <p data-n="117">Applause; in generality, well fam’d,</p>
  <p data-n="118">If trim behavior, gestures mild, discreet</p>
  <p data-n="119">Endeavors, modest speech, beseeming mirth,</p>
  <p data-n="120">True friendship, active grace, persuasion sweet,</p>
  <p data-n="121">Delightful love innated from his birth,</p>
  <p data-n="122">Acquaintance unfamiliar, carriage just,</p>
  <p data-n="123">Offenseless resolution, wish’d sobriety,</p>
  <p data-n="124">Clean-temper’d moderation, steady trust,</p>
  <p data-n="125">Unburthen’d conscience, unfeign’d piety;</p>
  <p data-n="126">If these, or all of these, knit fast in one</p>
  <p data-n="127">Can merit praise, then justly may we say,</p>
  <p data-n="128">Not any from this frailer stage is gone</p>
  <p data-n="129">Whose name is like to live a longer day—</p>
  <p data-n="130">Though not in eminent courts or places great</p>
  <p data-n="131">For popular concourse, yet in that soil</p>
  <p data-n="132">Where he enjoy’d his birth, life, death, and seat</p>
  <p data-n="133">Which now sits mourning his untimely spoil. A</p>
  <p data-n="134">nd as much glory is it to be good</p>
  <p data-n="135">For private persons, in their private home,</p>
  <p data-n="136">As those descended from illustrious blood</p>
  <p data-n="137">In public view of greatness, whence they come.</p>
  <p data-n="138">Though I, rewarded with some sadder taste</p>
  <p data-n="139">Of knowing shame, by feeling it have prov’d</p>
  <p data-n="140">My country’s thankless misconstruction cast</p>
  <p data-n="141">Upon my name and credit, both unlov’d</p>
  <p data-n="142">By some whose fortunes, sunk into the wane</p>
  <p data-n="143">Of plenty and desert, have strove to win</p>
  <p data-n="144">Justice by wrong, and sifted to embane</p>
  <p data-n="145">My reputation with a witless sin;</p>
  <p data-n="146">Yet time, the father of unblushing truth,</p>
  <p data-n="147">May one day lay ope malice which hath cross’d it,</p>
  <p data-n="148">And right the hopes of my endangered youth,</p>
  <p data-n="149">Purchasing credit in the place I lost it.</p>
  <p data-n="150">Even in which place the subject of the verse</p>
  <p data-n="151">(Unhappy matter of a mourning style</p>
  <p data-n="152">Which now that subject’s merits doth rehearse)</p>
  <p data-n="153">Had education and new being; while</p>
  <p data-n="154">By fair demeanor he had won repute</p>
  <p data-n="155">Amongst the all of all that lived there,</p>
  <p data-n="156">For that his actions did so wholly suit</p>
  <p data-n="157">With worthiness, still memorable here.</p>
  <p data-n="158">The many hours till the day of doom</p>
  <p data-n="159">Will not consume his life and hapless end,</p>
  <p data-n="160">For should he lie obscur’d without a tomb,</p>
  <p data-n="161">Time would to time his honesty commend;</p>
  <p data-n="162">Whiles parents to their children will make known,</p>
  <p data-n="163">And they to their posterity impart,</p>
  <p data-n="164">How such a man was sadly overthrown</p>
  <p data-n="165">By a hand guided by a cruel heart,</p>
  <p data-n="166">Whereof as many as shall hear that sadness</p>
  <p data-n="167">Will blame the one’s hard fate, the other’s madness;</p>
  <p data-n="168">Whiles such as do recount that tale of woe,</p>
  <p data-n="169">Told by remembrance of the wisest heads,</p>
  <p data-n="170">Will in the end conclude the matter so,</p>
  <p data-n="171">As they will all go weeping to their beds.</p>
  <p data-n="172">For when the world lies winter’d in the storms</p>
  <p data-n="173">Of fearful consummation, and lays down</p>
  <p data-n="174">Th’ unsteady change of his fantastic forms,</p>
  <p data-n="175">Expecting ever to be overthrown;</p>
  <p data-n="176">When the proud height of much affected sin</p>
  <p data-n="177">Shall ripen to a head, and in that pride</p>
  <p data-n="178">End in the miseries it did begin</p>
  <p data-n="179">And fall amidst the glory of his tide;</p>
  <p data-n="180">Then in a book where every work is writ</p>
  <p data-n="181">Shall this man’s actions be reveal’d, to show</p>
  <p data-n="182">The gainful fruit of well-employed wit,</p>
  <p data-n="183">Which paid to heaven the debt that it did owe.</p>
  <p data-n="184">Here shall be reckon’d up the constant faith,</p>
  <p data-n="185">Never untrue, where once he love profess’d;</p>
  <p data-n="186">Which is a miracle in men, one saith,</p>
  <p data-n="187">Long sought though rarely found, and he is best</p>
  <p data-n="188">Who can make friendship, in those times of change,</p>
  <p data-n="189">Admired more for being firm than strange.</p>
  <p data-n="190">When those weak houses of our brittle flesh</p>
  <p data-n="191">Shall ruin’d be by death, our grace and strength,</p>
  <p data-n="192">Youth, memory and shape that made us fresh</p>
  <p data-n="193">Cast down, and utterly decay’d at length;</p>
  <p data-n="194">When all shall turn to dust from whence we came</p>
  <p data-n="195">And we low-level’d in a narrow grave,</p>
  <p data-n="196">What can we leave behind us but a name,</p>
  <p data-n="197">Which, by a life well led, may honor have?</p>
  <p data-n="198">Such honor, O thou youth untimely lost,</p>
  <p data-n="199">Thou didst deserve and hast; for though thy soul</p>
  <p data-n="200">Hath took her flight to a diviner coast,</p>
  <p data-n="201">Yet here on earth thy fame lives ever whole,</p>
  <p data-n="202">In every heart seal’d up, in every tongue</p>
  <p data-n="203">Fit matter to discourse, no day prevented</p>
  <p data-n="204">That pities not thy sad and sudden wrong,</p>
  <p data-n="205">Of all alike beloved and lamented.</p>
  <p data-n="206">And I here to thy memorable worth,</p>
  <p data-n="207">In this last act of friendship, sacrifice</p>
  <p data-n="208">My love to thee, which I could not set forth</p>
  <p data-n="209">In any other habit of disguise.</p>
  <p data-n="210">Although I could not learn, whiles yet thou wert,</p>
  <p data-n="211">To speak the language of a servile breath,</p>
  <p data-n="212">My truth stole from my tongue into my heart,</p>
  <p data-n="213">Which shall not thence be sund’red, but in death.</p>
  <p data-n="214">And I confess my love was too remiss</p>
  <p data-n="215">That had not made thee know how much I priz’d thee,</p>
  <p data-n="216">But that mine error was, as yet it is,</p>
  <p data-n="217">To think love best in silence: for I siz’d thee</p>
  <p data-n="218">By what I would have been, not only ready</p>
  <p data-n="219">In telling I was thine, but being so,</p>
  <p data-n="220">By some effect to show it. He is steady</p>
  <p data-n="221">Who seems less than he is in open show.</p>
  <p data-n="222">Since then I still reserv’d to try the worst</p>
  <p data-n="223">Which hardest fate and time thus can lay on me.</p>
  <p data-n="224">T’ enlarge my thoughts was hindered at first,</p>
  <p data-n="225">While thou hadst life; I took this task upon me,</p>
  <p data-n="226">To register with mine unhappy pen</p>
  <p data-n="227">Such duties as it owes to thy desert,</p>
  <p data-n="228">And set thee as a president to men,</p>
  <p data-n="229">And limn thee to the world but as thou wert—</p>
  <p data-n="230">Not hir’d, as heaven can witness in my soul,</p>
  <p data-n="231">By vain conceit, to please such ones as know it,</p>
  <p data-n="232">Nor servile to be lik’d, free from control,</p>
  <p data-n="233">Which, pain to many men, I do not owe it.</p>
  <p data-n="234">But here I trust I have discharged now</p>
  <p data-n="235">(Fair lovely branch too soon cut off) to thee,</p>
  <p data-n="236">My constant and irrefragable vow,</p>
  <p data-n="237">As, had it chanc’d, thou mightst have done to me—</p>
  <p data-n="238">But that no merit strong enough of mine</p>
  <p data-n="239">Had yielded store to thy well-abled quill</p>
  <p data-n="240">Whereby t’enroll my name, as this of thine,</p>
  <p data-n="241">How s’ere enriched by thy plenteous skill.</p>
  <p data-n="242">Here, then, I offer up to memory</p>
  <p data-n="243">The value of my talent, precious man,</p>
  <p data-n="244">Whereby if thou live to posterity,</p>
  <p data-n="245">Though’t be not as I would, ’tis as I can:</p>
  <p data-n="246">In minds from whence endeavor doth proceed,</p>
  <p data-n="247">A ready will is taken for the deed.</p>
  <p data-n="248">Yet ere I take my longest last farewell</p>
  <p data-n="249">From thee, fair mark of sorrow, let me frame</p>
  <p data-n="250">Some ampler work of thank, wherein to tell</p>
  <p data-n="251">What more thou didst deserve than in thy name,</p>
  <p data-n="252">And free thee from the scandal of such senses</p>
  <p data-n="253">As in the rancor of unhappy spleen</p>
  <p data-n="254">Measure thy course of life, with false pretenses</p>
  <p data-n="255">Comparing by thy death what thou hast been.</p>
  <p data-n="256">So in his mischiefs is the world accurs’d:</p>
  <p data-n="257">It picks out matter to inform the worst.</p>
  <p data-n="258">The willful blindness that hoodwinks the eyes</p>
  <p data-n="259">Of men enwrapped in an earthy veil</p>
  <p data-n="260">Makes them most ignorantly exercise</p>
  <p data-n="261">And yield to humor when it doth assail,</p>
  <p data-n="262">Whereby the candle and the body’s light</p>
  <p data-n="263">Darkens the inward eyesight of the mind,</p>
  <p data-n="264">Presuming still it sees, even in the night</p>
  <p data-n="265">Of that same ignorance which makes them blind.</p>
  <p data-n="266">Hence conster they with corrupt commentaries,</p>
  <p data-n="267">Proceeding from a nature as corrupt,</p>
  <p data-n="268">The text of malice, which so often varies</p>
  <p data-n="269">As ’tis by seeming reason underpropp’d.</p>
  <p data-n="270">O, whither tends the lamentable spite</p>
  <p data-n="271">Of this world’s teenful apprehension,</p>
  <p data-n="272">Which understands all things amiss, whose light</p>
  <p data-n="273">Shines not amidst the dark of their dissension?</p>
  <p data-n="274">True ’tis, this man, whiles yet he was a man,</p>
  <p data-n="275">Sooth’d not the current of besotted fashion,</p>
  <p data-n="276">Nor could digest, as some loose mimics can,</p>
  <p data-n="277">An empty sound of overweening passion,</p>
  <p data-n="278">So much to be made servant to the base</p>
  <p data-n="279">And sensual aptness of disunion’d vices,</p>
  <p data-n="280">To purchase commendation by disgrace,</p>
  <p data-n="281">Whereto the world and heat of sin entices.</p>
  <p data-n="282">But in a safer contemplation,</p>
  <p data-n="283">Secure in what he knew, he ever chose</p>
  <p data-n="284">The ready way to commendation,</p>
  <p data-n="285">By shunning all invitements strange, of those</p>
  <p data-n="286">Whose illness is, the necessary praise</p>
  <p data-n="287">Must wait upon their actions; only rare</p>
  <p data-n="288">In being rare in shame (which strives to raise</p>
  <p data-n="289">Their name by doing what they do not care),</p>
  <p data-n="290">As if the free commission of their ill</p>
  <p data-n="291">Were even as boundless as their prompt desires;</p>
  <p data-n="292">Only like lords, like subjects to their will,</p>
  <p data-n="293">Which their fond dotage ever more admires.</p>
  <p data-n="294">He was not so: but in a serious awe,</p>
  <p data-n="295">Ruling the little ordered commonwealth</p>
  <p data-n="296">Of his own self, with honor to the law</p>
  <p data-n="297">That gave peace to his bread, bread to his health;</p>
  <p data-n="298">Which ever he maintain’d in sweet content</p>
  <p data-n="299">And pleasurable rest, wherein he joy’d</p>
  <p data-n="300">A monarchy of comfort’s government,</p>
  <p data-n="301">Never until his last to be destroy’d.</p>
  <p data-n="302">For in the Vineyard of heaven-favored learning</p>
  <p data-n="303">Where he was double-honor’d in degree,</p>
  <p data-n="304">His observation and discreet discerning</p>
  <p data-n="305">Had taught him in both fortunes to be free;</p>
  <p data-n="306">Whence now retir’d home, to a home indeed</p>
  <p data-n="307">The home of his condition and estate,</p>
  <p data-n="308">He well provided ’gainst the hand of need,</p>
  <p data-n="309">Whence young men sometime grow unfortunate;</p>
  <p data-n="310">His disposition, by the bonds of unity,</p>
  <p data-n="311">So fast’ned to his reason that it strove</p>
  <p data-n="312">With understanding’s grave immunity</p>
  <p data-n="313">To purchase from all hearts a steady love;</p>
  <p data-n="314">Wherein not any one thing comprehends</p>
  <p data-n="315">Proportionable note of what he was,</p>
  <p data-n="316">Than that he was so constant to his friends</p>
  <p data-n="317">As he would no occasion overpass</p>
  <p data-n="318">Which might make known his unaffected care,</p>
  <p data-n="319">In all respects of trial, to unlock</p>
  <p data-n="320">His bosom and his store, which did declare</p>
  <p data-n="321">That Christ was his, and he was Friendship’s Rock:</p>
  <p data-n="322">A Rock of Friendship figured in his name,</p>
  <p data-n="323">Fore-shewing what he was, and what should be,</p>
  <p data-n="324">Most true presage; and he discharg’d the same</p>
  <p data-n="325">In every act of perfect amity—</p>
  <p data-n="326">Though in the complemental phrase of words</p>
  <p data-n="327">He never was addicted to the vain</p>
  <p data-n="328">Of boast, such as the common breath affords;</p>
  <p data-n="329">He was in use most fast, in tongue most plain,</p>
  <p data-n="330">Nor amongst all those virtues that forever</p>
  <p data-n="331">Adorn’d his reputation will be found</p>
  <p data-n="332">One greater than his Faith, which did persever,</p>
  <p data-n="333">Where once it was protested, alway sound.</p>
  <p data-n="334">Hence sprung the deadly fuel that reviv’d</p>
  <p data-n="335">The rage which wrought his end, for had he been</p>
  <p data-n="336">Slacker in love, he had been longer liv’d</p>
  <p data-n="337">And not oppress’d by wrath’s unhappy sin—</p>
  <p data-n="338">By wrath’s unhappy sin, which unadvis’d</p>
  <p data-n="339">Gave death for free good will, and wounds for love.</p>
  <p data-n="340">Pity it was that blood had not been priz’d</p>
  <p data-n="341">At higher rate, and reason set above</p>
  <p data-n="342">Most unjust choler, which untimely</p>
  <p data-n="343">Drew Destruction on itself; and most unjust,</p>
  <p data-n="344">Robb’d virtue of a follower so true</p>
  <p data-n="345">As time can boast of, both for love and trust:</p>
  <p data-n="346">So henceforth all (great glory to his blood)</p>
  <p data-n="347">Shall be but seconds to him, being good.</p>
  <p data-n="348">The wicked end their honor with their sin</p>
  <p data-n="349">In death, which only then the good begin.</p>
  <p data-n="350">Lo, here a lesson by experience taught</p>
  <p data-n="351">For men whose pure simplicity hath drawn</p>
  <p data-n="352">Their trust to be betray’d by being caught</p>
  <p data-n="353">Within the snares of making truth a pawn;</p>
  <p data-n="354">Whiles it, not doubting whereinto it enters,</p>
  <p data-n="355">Without true proof and knowledge of a friend,</p>
  <p data-n="356">Sincere in singleness of heart, adventers</p>
  <p data-n="357">To give fit cause, ere love begin to end:</p>
  <p data-n="358">His unfeign’d friendship where it least was sought,</p>
  <p data-n="359">Him to a fatal timeless ruin brought;</p>
  <p data-n="360">Whereby the life that purity adorn’d</p>
  <p data-n="361">With real merit, by this sudden end</p>
  <p data-n="362">Is in the mouth of some in manner scorn’d,</p>
  <p data-n="363">Made questionable, for they do intend,</p>
  <p data-n="364">According to the tenor of the saw</p>
  <p data-n="365">Mistook, if not observ’d (writ long ago</p>
  <p data-n="366">When men were only led by Reason’s law),</p>
  <p data-n="367">That "Such as is the end, the life proves so."</p>
  <p data-n="368">Thus he, who to the universal lapse</p>
  <p data-n="369">Gave sweet redemption, off’ring up his blood</p>
  <p data-n="370">To conquer death by death, and loose the traps</p>
  <p data-n="371">Of hell, even in the triumph that it stood:</p>
  <p data-n="372">He thus, for that his guiltless life was spilt</p>
  <p data-n="373">By death, which was made subject to the curse,</p>
  <p data-n="374">Might in like manner be reprov’d of guilt</p>
  <p data-n="375">In his pure life, for that his end was worse.</p>
  <p data-n="376">But O far be it, our unholy lips</p>
  <p data-n="377">Should so profane the deity above</p>
  <p data-n="378">As thereby to ordain revenging whips</p>
  <p data-n="379">Against the day of Judgment and of Love.</p>
  <p data-n="380">The hand that lends us honor in our days</p>
  <p data-n="381">May shorten when it please, and justly take</p>
  <p data-n="382">Our honor from us many sundry ways,</p>
  <p data-n="383">As best becomes that wisdom did us make.</p>
  <p data-n="384">The second brother, who was next begot</p>
  <p data-n="385">Of all that ever were begotten yet,</p>
  <p data-n="386">Was by a hand in vengeance rude and hot</p>
  <p data-n="387">Sent innocent to be in heaven set—</p>
  <p data-n="388">Whose fame the angels in melodious choirs</p>
  <p data-n="389">Still witness to the world. Then why should he,</p>
  <p data-n="390">Well-profited in excellent desires,</p>
  <p data-n="391">Be more rebuk’d, who had like destiny?</p>
  <p data-n="392">Those saints before the everlasting throne</p>
  <p data-n="393">Who sit with crowns of glory on their heads,</p>
  <p data-n="394">Wash’d white in blood, from earth hence have not gone</p>
  <p data-n="395">All to their joys in quiet on their beds,</p>
  <p data-n="396">But tasted of the sour-bitter scourge</p>
  <p data-n="397">Of torture and affliction ere they gained</p>
  <p data-n="398">Those blessings which their sufferance did urge,</p>
  <p data-n="399">Whereby the grace fore-promis’d they attained.</p>
  <p data-n="400">Let then the false suggestions of the froward,</p>
  <p data-n="401">Building large castles in the empty air,</p>
  <p data-n="402">By suppositions fond and thoughts untoward</p>
  <p data-n="403">(Issues of discontent and sick despair)</p>
  <p data-n="404">Rebound gross arguments upon their heart</p>
  <p data-n="405">That may disprove their malice, and confound</p>
  <p data-n="406">Uncivil loose opinions which insert</p>
  <p data-n="407">Their souls into the roll that doth unsound</p>
  <p data-n="408">Betraying policies, and show their brains,</p>
  <p data-n="409">Unto their shame, ridiculous; whose scope</p>
  <p data-n="410">Is envy, whose endeavors fruitless pains,</p>
  <p data-n="411">In nothing surely prosperous, but hope—</p>
  <p data-n="412">And that same hope, so lame, so unprevailing,</p>
  <p data-n="413">It buries self-conceit in weak opinion;</p>
  <p data-n="414">Which being cross’d, gives matter of bewailing</p>
  <p data-n="415">Their vain designs, on whom want hath dominion.</p>
  <p data-n="416">Such, and of such condition, may devise</p>
  <p data-n="417">Which way to wound with defamation’s spirit</p>
  <p data-n="418">(Close-lurking whisper’s hidden forgeries)</p>
  <p data-n="419">His taintless goodness, his desertful merit.</p>
  <p data-n="420">But whiles the minds of men can judge sincerely,</p>
  <p data-n="421">Upon assured knowledge, his repute</p>
  <p data-n="422">And estimation shall be rumor’d clearly</p>
  <p data-n="423">In equal worth—time shall to time renew ’t.</p>
  <p data-n="424">The Grave-that in his ever-empty womb</p>
  <p data-n="425">Forever closes up the unrespected</p>
  <p data-n="426">Who, when they die, die all—shall not entomb</p>
  <p data-n="427">His pleading best perfections as neglected.</p>
  <p data-n="428">They to his notice in succeeding years</p>
  <p data-n="429">Shall speak for him when he shall lie below;</p>
  <p data-n="430">When nothing but his memory appears</p>
  <p data-n="431">Of what he was, then shall his virtues grow.</p>
  <p data-n="432">His being but a private man in rank</p>
  <p data-n="433">(And yet not rank’d beneath a gentleman)</p>
  <p data-n="434">Shall not abridge the commendable thank</p>
  <p data-n="435">Which wise posterity shall give him then;</p>
  <p data-n="436">For Nature, and his therein happy Fate.</p>
  <p data-n="437">Ordain’d that by his quality of mind</p>
  <p data-n="438">T’ ennoble that best part, although his state</p>
  <p data-n="439">Were to a lower blessedness confin’d.</p>
  <p data-n="440">Blood, pomp, state, honor, glory and command,</p>
  <p data-n="441">Without fit ornaments of disposition,</p>
  <p data-n="442">Are in themselves but heathenish and profane,</p>
  <p data-n="443">And much more peaceful is a mean condition</p>
  <p data-n="444">Which, underneath the roof of safe content,</p>
  <p data-n="445">Feeds on the bread of rest, and takes delight</p>
  <p data-n="446">To look upon the labors it hath spent</p>
  <p data-n="447">For its own sustenance, both day and night;</p>
  <p data-n="448">Whiles others, plotting which way to be great,</p>
  <p data-n="449">How to augment their portion and ambition,</p>
  <p data-n="450">Do toil their giddy brains, and ever sweat</p>
  <p data-n="451">For popular applause and power’s commission.</p>
  <p data-n="452">But one in honors, like a sealed dove</p>
  <p data-n="453">Whose inward eyes are dimm’d with dignity,</p>
  <p data-n="454">Does think most safety doth remain above,</p>
  <p data-n="455">And seeks to be secure by mounting high:</p>
  <p data-n="456">Whence, when he falls, who did erewhile aspire,</p>
  <p data-n="457">Falls deeper down, for that he climbed higher.</p>
  <p data-n="458">Now men who in a lower region live</p>
  <p data-n="459">Exempt from danger of authority</p>
  <p data-n="460">Have fittest times in Reason’s rules to thrive,</p>
  <p data-n="461">Not vex’d with envy of priority,</p>
  <p data-n="462">And those are much more noble in the mind</p>
  <p data-n="463">Than many that have nobleness by kind.</p>
  <p data-n="464">Birth, blood, and ancestors, are none of ours,</p>
  <p data-n="465">Nor can we make a proper challenge to them,</p>
  <p data-n="466">But virtues and perfections in our powers</p>
  <p data-n="467">Proceed most truly from us, if we do them.</p>
  <p data-n="468">Respective titles or a gracious style,</p>
  <p data-n="469">With all what men in eminence possess,</p>
  <p data-n="470">Are, without ornaments to praise them, vile:</p>
  <p data-n="471">The beauty of the mind is nobleness.</p>
  <p data-n="472">And such as have that beauty, well deserve</p>
  <p data-n="473">Eternal characters, that after death</p>
  <p data-n="474">Remembrance of their worth we may preserve,</p>
  <p data-n="475">So that their glory die not with their breath.</p>
  <p data-n="476">Else what avails it in a goodly strife</p>
  <p data-n="477">Upon this face of earth here to contend,</p>
  <p data-n="478">The good t’exceed the wicked in their life,</p>
  <p data-n="479">Should both be like obscured in their end?</p>
  <p data-n="480">Until which end, there is none rightly can</p>
  <p data-n="481">Be termed happy, since the happiness</p>
  <p data-n="482">Depends upon the goodness of the man,</p>
  <p data-n="483">Which afterwards his praises will express.</p>
  <p data-n="484">Look hither then, you that enjoy the youth</p>
  <p data-n="485">Of your best days, and see how unexpected</p>
  <p data-n="486">Death can betray your jollity to ruth</p>
  <p data-n="487">When death you think is least to be respected!</p>
  <p data-n="488">The person of this model here set out</p>
  <p data-n="489">Had all that youth and happy days could give him,</p>
  <p data-n="490">Yet could not all-encompass him about</p>
  <p data-n="491">Against th’assault of death, who to relieve him</p>
  <p data-n="492">Struck home but to the frail and mortal parts</p>
  <p data-n="493">Of his humanity, but could not touch</p>
  <p data-n="494">His flourishing and fair long-liv’d deserts,</p>
  <p data-n="495">Above fate’s reach, his singleness was such—</p>
  <p data-n="496">So that he dies but once, but doubly lives,</p>
  <p data-n="497">Once in his proper self, then in his name;</p>
  <p data-n="498">Predestinated Time, who all deprives,</p>
  <p data-n="499">Could never yet deprive him of the same.</p>
  <p data-n="500">And had the Genius which attended on him</p>
  <p data-n="501">Been possibilited to keep him safe</p>
  <p data-n="502">Against the rigor that hath overgone him,</p>
  <p data-n="503">He had been to the public use a staff,</p>
  <p data-n="504">Leading by his example in the path</p>
  <p data-n="505">Which guides to doing well, wherein so few</p>
  <p data-n="506">The proneness of this age to error hath</p>
  <p data-n="507">Informed rightly in the courses true.</p>
  <p data-n="508">As then the loss of one, whose inclination</p>
  <p data-n="509">Strove to win love in general, is sad,</p>
  <p data-n="510">So specially his friends, in soft compassion</p>
  <p data-n="511">Do feel the greatest loss they could have had.</p>
  <p data-n="512">Amongst them all, she who those nine of years</p>
  <p data-n="513">Liv’d fellow to his counsels and his bed</p>
  <p data-n="514">Hath the most share in loss: for I in hers</p>
  <p data-n="515">Feel what distemperature this chance hath bred.</p>
  <p data-n="516">The chaste embracements of conjugal love,</p>
  <p data-n="517">Who in a mutual harmony consent,</p>
  <p data-n="518">Are so impatient of a strange remove</p>
  <p data-n="519">As meager death itself seems to lament,</p>
  <p data-n="520">And weep upon those cheeks which nature fram’d</p>
  <p data-n="521">To be delightful orbs in whom the force</p>
  <p data-n="522">Of lively sweetness plays, so that asham’d</p>
  <p data-n="523">Death often pities his unkind divorce.</p>
  <p data-n="524">Such was the separation here constrain’d</p>
  <p data-n="525">(Well-worthy to be termed a rudeness rather),</p>
  <p data-n="526">For in his life his love was so unfeign’d</p>
  <p data-n="527">As he was both an husband and a father—</p>
  <p data-n="528">The one in firm affection and the other</p>
  <p data-n="529">In careful providence, which ever strove</p>
  <p data-n="530">With joint assistance to grace one another</p>
  <p data-n="531">With every helpful furtherance of love.</p>
  <p data-n="532">But since the sum of all that can be said</p>
  <p data-n="533">Can be but said that "He was good"</p>
  <p data-n="534">(which wholly Includes all excellence can be display’d</p>
  <p data-n="535">In praise of virtue and reproach of folly).</p>
  <p data-n="536">His due deserts, this sentence on him gives,</p>
  <p data-n="537">"He died in life, yet in his death he lives."</p>
  <p data-n="538">Now runs the method of this doleful song</p>
  <p data-n="539">In accents brief to thee, O thou deceas’d!</p>
  <p data-n="540">To whom those pains do only all belong</p>
  <p data-n="541">As witnesses I did not love thee least.</p>
  <p data-n="542">For could my worthless brain find out but how</p>
  <p data-n="543">To raise thee from the sepulcher of dust,</p>
  <p data-n="544">Undoubtedly thou shouldst have partage now</p>
  <p data-n="545">Of life with me, and heaven be counted just</p>
  <p data-n="546">If to a supplicating soul it would</p>
  <p data-n="547">Give life anew, by giving life again</p>
  <p data-n="548">Where life is miss’d; whereby discomfort should</p>
  <p data-n="549">Right his old griefs, and former joys retain</p>
  <p data-n="550">Which now with thee are leap’d into thy tomb</p>
  <p data-n="551">And buried in that hollow vault of woe,</p>
  <p data-n="552">Expecting yet a more severer doom</p>
  <p data-n="553">Than time’s strict flinty hand will let ’em know.</p>
  <p data-n="554">And now if I have level’d mine account</p>
  <p data-n="555">And reckon’d up in a true measured score</p>
  <p data-n="556">Those perfect graces which were ever wont</p>
  <p data-n="557">To wait on thee alive, I ask no more</p>
  <p data-n="558">(But shall hereafter in a poor content</p>
  <p data-n="559">Immure those imputations I sustain,</p>
  <p data-n="560">Learning my days of youth so to prevent</p>
  <p data-n="561">As not to be cast down by them again)—</p>
  <p data-n="562">Only those hopes which fate denies to grant</p>
  <p data-n="563">In full possession to a captive heart</p>
  <p data-n="564">Who, if it were in plenty, still would want</p>
  <p data-n="565">Before it may enjoy his better part;</p>
  <p data-n="566">From which detain’d, and banish’d in th’ exile</p>
  <p data-n="567">Of dim misfortune, has none other prop</p>
  <p data-n="568">Whereon to lean and rest itself the while</p>
  <p data-n="569">But the weak comfort of the hapless, Hope.</p>
  <p data-n="570">And Hope must in despite of fearful change</p>
  <p data-n="571">Play in the strongest closet of my breast,</p>
  <p data-n="572">Although perhaps I ignorantly range</p>
  <p data-n="573">And court opinion in my deep’st unrest.</p>
  <p data-n="574">But whether doth the stream of my mischance</p>
  <p data-n="575">Drive me beyond myself, fast friend, soon lost,</p>
  <p data-n="576">Long may thy worthiness thy name advance</p>
  <p data-n="577">Amongst the virtuous and deserving most,</p>
  <p data-n="578">Who herein hast forever happy prov’d:</p>
  <p data-n="579">In life thou liv’dst, in death thou died’st belov’d.</p>
