<h4>London. A room of state in the palace.</h4>

<div class="stage-direction">
	Enter King Edward, Derby, Prince Edward, Audley, and Artois.
	
		KING EDWARD.

		PRINCE EDWARD.
		AUDLEY.

		Lords
	
</div>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD.">
  <li class="number">Robert of Artois, banished though thou be</li>
  <li class="number">From France, thy native Country, yet with us</li>
  <li class="number">Thou shalt retain as great a Seigniorie:</li>
  <li class="number">For we create thee Earl of Richmond here.</li>
  <li class="number">And now go forwards with our pedigree:</li>
  <li class="number">Who next succeeded Philip le Bew?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ARTOIS.">
  <li class="number">Three sons of his, which all successfully</li>
  <li class="number">Did sit upon their father’s regal throne,</li>
  <li class="number">Yet died, and left no issue of their loins.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD.">
  <li class="number">But was my mother sister unto those?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ARTOIS.">
  <li class="number">She was, my lord; and only Isabel</li>
  <li class="number">Was all the daughters that this Philip had,</li>
  <li class="number">Whom afterward your father took to wife;</li>
  <li class="number">And from the fragrant garden of her womb</li>
  <li class="number">Your gracious self, the flower of Europe’s hope,</li>
  <li class="number">Derived is inheritor to France.</li>
  <li class="number">But note the rancor of rebellious minds:</li>
  <li class="number">When thus the lineage of le Bew was out,</li>
  <li class="number">The French obscured your mother’s privilege,</li>
  <li class="number">And, though she were the next of blood, proclaimed</li>
  <li class="number">John, of the house of Valois, now their king:</li>
  <li class="number">The reason was, they say, the realm of France,</li>
  <li class="number">Replete with princes of great parentage,</li>
  <li class="number">Ought not admit a governor to rule,</li>
  <li class="number">Except he be descended of the male;</li>
  <li class="number">And that’s the special ground of their contempt,</li>
  <li class="number">Wherewith they study to exclude your grace:</li>
  <li class="number">But they shall find that forged ground of theirs</li>
  <li class="number">To be but dusty heaps of brittle sand.</li>
  <li class="number">Perhaps it will be thought a heinous thing,</li>
  <li class="number">That I, a Frenchman, should discover this;</li>
  <li class="number">But heaven I call to record of my vows:</li>
  <li class="number">It is not hate nor any private wrong,</li>
  <li class="number">But love unto my country and the right,</li>
  <li class="number">Provokes my tongue, thus lavish in report.</li>
  <li class="number">You are the lineal watchman of our peace,</li>
  <li class="number">And John of Valois indirectly climbs;</li>
  <li class="number">What then should subjects but embrace their King?</li>
  <li class="number">Ah, where in may our duty more be seen,</li>
  <li class="number">Than striving to rebate a tyrant’s pride</li>
  <li class="number">And place the true shepherd of our commonwealth?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD.">
  <li class="number">This counsel, Artois, like to fruitful showers,</li>
  <li class="number">Hath added growth unto my dignity;</li>
  <li class="number">And, by the fiery vigor of thy words,</li>
  <li class="number">Hot courage is engendered in my breast,</li>
  <li class="number">Which heretofore was raked in ignorance,</li>
  <li class="number">But now doth mount with golden wings of fame,</li>
  <li class="number">And will approve fair Isabel’s descent,</li>
  <li class="number">Able to yoke their stubborn necks with steel,</li>
  <li class="number">That spurn against my sovereignty in France.</li>

<ol data-speaker="AUDLEY.">
  <li class="number">The Duke of Lorraine, having crossed the seas,</li>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD.">

		LORRAINE.
	
</li>
  <li class="number">Say, Duke of Lorraine, wherefore art thou come?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LORRAINE.">
  <li class="number">The most renowned prince, King John of France,</li>
  <li class="number">Doth greet thee, Edward, and by me commands,</li>
  <li class="number">That, for so much as by his liberal gift</li>
  <li class="number">The Guyen Dukedom is entailed to thee,</li>
  <li class="number">Thou do him lowly homage for the same.</li>
  <li class="number">And, for that purpose, here I summon thee,</li>
  <li class="number">Repair to France within these forty days,</li>
  <li class="number">That there, according as the custom is,</li>
  <li class="number">Thou mayst be sworn true liegeman to our King;</li>
  <li class="number">Or else thy title in that province dies,</li>
  <li class="number">And he himself will repossess the place.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD.">
  <li class="number">See, how occasion laughs me in the face!</li>
  <li class="number">No sooner minded to prepare for France,</li>
  <li class="number">But straight I am invited,—nay, with threats,</li>
  <li class="number">Upon a penalty, enjoined to come:</li>
  <li class="number">’Twere but a childish part to say him nay.—</li>
  <li class="number">Lorraine, return this answer to thy lord:</li>
  <li class="number">I mean to visit him as he requests;</li>
  <li class="number">But how? Not servilely disposed to bend,</li>
  <li class="number">But like a conqueror to make him bow.</li>
  <li class="number">His lame unpolished shifts are come to light;</li>
  <li class="number">And truth hath pulled the vizard from his face,</li>
  <li class="number">That set a gloss upon his arrogance.</li>
  <li class="number">Dare he command a fealty in me?</li>
  <li class="number">Tell him, the Crown that he usurps, is mine,</li>
  <li class="number">And where he sets his foot, he ought to kneel.</li>
  <li class="number">’Tis not a petty dukedom that I claim,</li>
  <li class="number">But all the whole dominions of the realm;</li>
  <li class="number">Which if with grudging he refuse to yield,</li>
  <li class="number">I’ll take away those borrowed plumes of his,</li>
  <li class="number">And send him naked to the wilderness.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LORRAINE.">
  <li class="number">Then, Edward, here, in spite of all thy lords,</li>
  <li class="number">I do pronounce defiance to thy face.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE EDWARD.">
  <li class="number">Defiance, Frenchman? We rebound it back,</li>
  <li class="number">Even to the bottom of thy master’s throat.</li>
  <li class="number">And, be it spoke with reverence of the king,</li>
  <li class="number">My gracious father, and these other lords,</li>
  <li class="number">I hold thy message but as scurrilous,</li>
  <li class="number">And him that sent thee, like the lazy drone,</li>
  <li class="number">Crept up by stealth unto the eagle’s nest;</li>
  <li class="number">From whence we’ll shake him with so rough a storm,</li>
  <li class="number">As others shall be warned by his harm.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WARWICK.">
  <li class="number">Bid him leave of the lion’s case he wears,</li>
  <li class="number">Least, meeting with the lion in the field,</li>
  <li class="number">He chance to tear him piecemeal for his pride.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ARTOIS.">
  <li class="number">The soundest counsel I can give his grace,</li>
  <li class="number">Is to surrender ere he be constrained.</li>
  <li class="number">A voluntary mischief hath less scorn,</li>
  <li class="number">Than when reproach with violence is borne.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LORRAINE.">
  <li class="number">Degenerate traitor, viper to the place</li>
  <li class="number">Where thou was fostered in thine infancy,</li>
  <li class="number">Bearest thou a part in this conspiracy?</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD.">
  <li class="number">Lorraine, behold the sharpness of this steel:</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">
	Drawing his.
	
		KING EDWARD.
	
</li>
  <li class="number">Fervent desire that sits against my heart,</li>
  <li class="number">Is far more thorny pricking than this blade;</li>
  <li class="number">That, with the nightingale, I shall be scared,</li>
  <li class="number">As oft as I dispose myself to rest,</li>
  <li class="number">Until my colors be displayed in France:</li>
  <li class="number">This is my final answer; so be gone.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LORRAINE.">
  <li class="number">It is not that, nor any English brave,</li>
  <li class="number">Afflicts me so, as doth his poisoned view,</li>
  <li class="number">That is most false, should most of all be true.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">
	Exeunt Lorraine, and Train.
	
		LORRAINE.
		Lords
	
</div>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD.">
  <li class="number">Now, lord, our fleeting bark is under sail;</li>
  <li class="number">Our gage is thrown, and war is soon begun,</li>
  <li class="number">But not so quickly brought unto an end.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">
	Enter Mountague.
	
		MOUNTAGUE.
	
</li>
  <li class="number">But wherefore comes Sir William Mountague?</li>
  <li class="number">How stands the league between the Scot and us?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOUNTAGUE.">
  <li class="number">Cracked and dissevered, my renowned lord.</li>
  <li class="number">The treacherous King no sooner was informed</li>
  <li class="number">Of your with drawing of your army back,</li>
  <li class="number">But straight, forgetting of his former oath,</li>
  <li class="number">He made invasion on the bordering Towns:</li>
  <li class="number">Barwick is won, Newcastle spoiled and lost,</li>
  <li class="number">And now the tyrant hath begirt with siege</li>
  <li class="number">The castle of Rocksborough, where enclos’d</li>
  <li class="number">The Countess Salisbury is like to perish.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD.">
  <li class="number">That is thy daughter, Warwick, is it not?</li>
  <li class="number">Whose husband hath in Britain served so long</li>
  <li class="number">About the planting of Lord Mountford there?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WARWICK.">
  <li class="number">It is, my lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD.">
  <li class="number">Ignoble David, hast thou none to grieve</li>
  <li class="number">But silly Ladies with thy threatening arms?</li>
  <li class="number">But I will make you shrink your snaily horns!</li>
  <li class="number">First, therefore, Audley, this shall be thy charge,</li>
  <li class="number">Go levy footmen for our wars in France;</li>
  <li class="number">And, Ned, take muster of our men at arms:</li>
  <li class="number">In every shire elect a several band.</li>
  <li class="number">Let them be Soldiers of a lusty spirit,</li>
  <li class="number">Such as dread nothing but dishonor’s blot;</li>
  <li class="number">Be wary, therefore, since we do commence</li>
  <li class="number">A famous war, and with so mighty a nation.</li>
  <li class="number">Derby, be thou ambassador for us</li>
  <li class="number">Unto our father in law, the Earl of Henalt:</li>
  <li class="number">Make him acquainted with our enterprise,</li>
  <li class="number">And likewise will him, with our own allies</li>
  <li class="number">That are in Flanders, to solicit to</li>
  <li class="number">The Emperor of Almaigne in our name.</li>
  <li class="number">Myself, whilst you are jointly thus employed,</li>
  <li class="number">Will, with these forces that I have at hand,</li>
  <li class="number">March, and once more repulse the traitorous Scot.</li>
  <li class="number">But, Sirs, be resolute: we shall have wars</li>
  <li class="number">On every side; and, Ned, thou must begin</li>
  <li class="number">Now to forget thy study and thy books,</li>
  <li class="number">And ure thy shoulders to an armor’s weight.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE EDWARD.">
  <li class="number">As cheerful sounding to my youthful spleen</li>
  <li class="number">This tumult is of war’s increasing broils,</li>
  <li class="number">As, at the coronation of a king,</li>
  <li class="number">The joyful clamors of the people are,</li>
  <li class="number">When “Ave, Caesar!” they pronounce aloud.</li>
  <li class="number">Within this school of honor I shall learn</li>
  <li class="number">Either to sacrifice my foes to death,</li>
  <li class="number">Or in a rightful quarrel spend my breath.</li>
  <li class="number">Then cheerfully forward, each a several way;</li>

  <li class="number">Then, dear my liege, now niggard not thy state:</li>
  <li class="number">Being at the wall, enter our homely gate.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD.">
  <li class="number">Pardon me, countess, I will come no near;</li>
  <li class="number">I dreamed tonight of treason, and I fear.</li>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD.">
  <li class="number">No farther off, than her conspiring eye,</li>
  <li class="number">Which shoots infected poison in my heart,</li>
  <li class="number">Beyond repulse of wit or cure of art.</li>
  <li class="number">Now, in the sun alone it doth not lie,</li>
  <li class="number">With light to take light from a mortal eye;</li>
  <li class="number">For here two day stars that mine eyes would see</li>
  <li class="number">More than the sun steals mine own light from me,</li>

  <li class="number">Our house, my liege, is like a country swain,</li>
  <li class="number">Whose habit rude and manners blunt and plain</li>
  <li class="number">Presageth nought, yet inly beautified</li>
  <li class="number">With bounties, riches and faire hidden pride.</li>
  <li class="number">For where the golden ore doth buried lie,</li>
  <li class="number">The ground, undecked with nature’s tapestry,</li>
  <li class="number">Seems barren, sere, unfertile, fructless, dry;</li>
  <li class="number">And where the upper turf of earth doth boast</li>
  <li class="number">His pied perfumes and party colored coat,</li>
  <li class="number">Delve there, and find this issue and their pride</li>
  <li class="number">To spring from ordure and corruption’s side.</li>
  <li class="number">But, to make up my all too long compare,</li>
  <li class="number">These ragged walls no testimony are,</li>
  <li class="number">What is within; but, like a cloak, doth hide</li>
  <li class="number">From weather’s Waste the under garnished pride.</li>
  <li class="number">More gracious then my terms can let thee be,</li>

  <li class="number">His ear to drink her sweet tongue’s utterance,</li>
  <li class="number">And changing passion, like inconstant clouds</li>
  <li class="number">That rack upon the carriage of the winds,</li>
  <li class="number">Increase and die in his disturbed cheeks.</li>
  <li class="number">Lo, when she blushed, even then did he look pale,</li>
  <li class="number">As if her cheeks by some enchanted power</li>
  <li class="number">Attracted had the cherry blood from his:</li>
  <li class="number">Anon, with reverent fear when she grew pale,</li>
  <li class="number">His cheeks put on their scarlet ornaments;</li>
  <li class="number">But no more like her oriental red,</li>
  <li class="number">Than brick to coral or live things to dead.</li>
  <li class="number">Why did he then thus counterfeit her looks?</li>
  <li class="number">If she did blush, twas tender modest shame,</li>
  <li class="number">Being in the sacred presence of a King;</li>
  <li class="number">If he did blush, twas red immodest shame,</li>
  <li class="number">To veil his eyes amiss, being a king;</li>
  <li class="number">If she looked pale, twas silly woman’s fear,</li>
  <li class="number">To bear herself in presence of a king;</li>
  <li class="number">If he looked pale, it was with guilty fear,</li>
  <li class="number">To dote amiss, being a mighty king.</li>
  <li class="number">Then, Scottish wars, farewell; I fear twill prove</li>

  <li class="number">She is grown more fairer far since I came hither,</li>
  <li class="number">Her voice more silver every word than other,</li>
  <li class="number">Her wit more fluent. What a strange discourse</li>
  <li class="number">Unfolded she of David and his Scots!</li>
  <li class="number">“Even thus,” quoth she, “he spake,” and then spoke broad,</li>
  <li class="number">With epithites and accents of the Scot,</li>
  <li class="number">But somewhat better than the Scot could speak:</li>
  <li class="number">“And thus,” quoth she, and answered then herself—</li>
  <li class="number">For who could speak like her but she herself—</li>
  <li class="number">Breathes from the wall an angel’s note from heaven</li>
  <li class="number">Of sweet defiance to her barbarous foes.</li>
  <li class="number">When she would talk of peace, methinks, her tongue</li>
  <li class="number">Commanded war to prison; when of war,</li>
  <li class="number">It wakened Caesar from his Roman grave,</li>
  <li class="number">To hear war beautified by her discourse.</li>
  <li class="number">Wisdom is foolishness but in her tongue,</li>
  <li class="number">Beauty a slander but in her fair face,</li>
  <li class="number">There is no summer but in her cheerful looks,</li>
  <li class="number">Nor frosty winter but in her disdain.</li>
  <li class="number">I cannot blame the Scots that did besiege her,</li>
  <li class="number">For she is all the treasure of our land;</li>
  <li class="number">But call them cowards, that they ran away,</li>
  <li class="number">Having so rich and fair a cause to stay.—</li>
  <li class="number">Art thou there, Lodowick? Give me ink and paper.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LODOWICK.">
  <li class="number">I will, my liege.</li>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD.">
  <li class="number">Hast thou pen, ink, and paper ready, Lodowick?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LODOWICK.">
  <li class="number">Ready, my liege.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD.">
  <li class="number">Then in the summer arbor sit by me,</li>
  <li class="number">Make it our counsel house or cabinet:</li>
  <li class="number">Since green our thoughts, green be the conventicle,</li>
  <li class="number">Where we will ease us by disburdening them.</li>
  <li class="number">Now, Lodowick, invocate some golden muse,</li>
  <li class="number">To bring thee hither an enchanted pen,</li>
  <li class="number">That may for sighs set down true sighs indeed,</li>
  <li class="number">Talking of grief, to make thee ready groan;</li>
  <li class="number">And when thou writest of tears, encouch the word</li>
  <li class="number">Before and after with such sweet laments,</li>
  <li class="number">That it may raise drops in a Tartar’s eye,</li>
  <li class="number">And make a flintheart Scythian pitiful;</li>
  <li class="number">For so much moving hath a Poet’s pen:</li>
  <li class="number">Then, if thou be a poet, move thou so,</li>
  <li class="number">And be enriched by thy sovereign’s love.</li>
  <li class="number">For, if the touch of sweet concordant strings</li>
  <li class="number">Could force attendance in the ears of hell,</li>
  <li class="number">How much more shall the strains of poets’ wit</li>
  <li class="number">Beguile and ravish soft and humane minds?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LODOWICK.">
  <li class="number">To whom, my lord, shall I direct my stile?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD.">
  <li class="number">To one that shames the fair and sots the wise;</li>
  <li class="number">Whose bod is an abstract or a brief,</li>
  <li class="number">Contains each general virtue in the world.</li>
  <li class="number">Better than beautiful thou must begin,</li>
  <li class="number">Devise for fair a fairer word than fair,</li>
  <li class="number">And every ornament that thou wouldest praise,</li>
  <li class="number">Fly it a pitch above the soar of praise.</li>
  <li class="number">For flattery fear thou not to be convicted;</li>
  <li class="number">For, were thy admiration ten times more,</li>
  <li class="number">Ten times ten thousand more the worth exceeds</li>
  <li class="number">Of that thou art to praise, thy praises worth.</li>
  <li class="number">Begin; I will to contemplate the while:</li>
  <li class="number">Forget not to set down, how passionate,</li>
  <li class="number">How heart sick, and how full of languishment,</li>
  <li class="number">Her beauty makes me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LODOWICK.">
  <li class="number">Write I to a woman?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD.">
  <li class="number">What beauty else could triumph over me,</li>
  <li class="number">Or who but women do our love lays greet?</li>
  <li class="number">What, thinkest thou I did bid thee praise a horse?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LODOWICK.">
  <li class="number">Of what condition or estate she is,</li>
  <li class="number">’Twere requisite that I should know, my lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD.">
  <li class="number">Of such estate, that hers is as a throne,</li>
  <li class="number">And my estate the footstool where she treads:</li>
  <li class="number">Then mayst thou judge what her condition is</li>
  <li class="number">By the proportion of her mightiness.</li>
  <li class="number">Write on, while I peruse her in my thoughts.—</li>
  <li class="number">Her voice to music or the nightingale—</li>
  <li class="number">To music every summer leaping swain</li>
  <li class="number">Compares his sunburnt lover when she speaks;</li>
  <li class="number">And why should I speak of the nightingale?</li>
  <li class="number">The nightingale sings of adulterate wrong,</li>
  <li class="number">And that, compared, is too satyrical;</li>
  <li class="number">For sin, though sin, would not be so esteemed,</li>
  <li class="number">But, rather, virtue sin, sin virtue deemed.</li>
  <li class="number">Her hair, far softer than the silk worm’s twist,</li>
  <li class="number">Like to a flattering glass, doth make more fair</li>
  <li class="number">The yellow Amber:—like a flattering glass</li>
  <li class="number">Comes in too soon; for, writing of her eyes,</li>
  <li class="number">I’ll say that like a glass they catch the sun,</li>
  <li class="number">And thence the hot reflection doth rebound</li>
  <li class="number">Against the breast, and burns my heart within.</li>
  <li class="number">Ah, what a world of descant makes my soul</li>
  <li class="number">Upon this voluntary ground of love!—</li>
  <li class="number">Come, Lodowick, hast thou turned thy ink to gold?</li>
  <li class="number">If not, write but in letters capital</li>
  <li class="number">My mistress’ name, and it will gild thy paper:</li>
  <li class="number">Read, lord, read;</li>
  <li class="number">Fill thou the empty hollows of mine ears</li>
  <li class="number">With the sweet hearing of thy poetry.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LODOWICK.">
  <li class="number">I have not to a period brought her praise.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD.">
  <li class="number">Her praise is as my love, both infinite,</li>
  <li class="number">Which apprehend such violent extremes,</li>
  <li class="number">That they disdain an ending period.</li>
  <li class="number">Her beauty hath no match but my affection;</li>
  <li class="number">Hers more than most, mine most and more than more:</li>
  <li class="number">Hers more to praise than tell the sea by drops,</li>
  <li class="number">Nay, more than drop the massy earth by sands,</li>
  <li class="number">And sand by sand print them in memory:</li>
  <li class="number">Then wherefore talkest thou of a period</li>
  <li class="number">To that which craves unended admiration?</li>
  <li class="number">Read, let us hear.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LODOWICK.">
  <li class="number"><recite>“More fair and chaste than is the queen of shades,”—</recite></li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD.">
  <li class="number">That line hath two faults, gross and palpable:</li>
  <li class="number">Comparest thou her to the pale queen of night,</li>
  <li class="number">Who, being set in dark, seems therefore light?</li>
  <li class="number">What is she, when the sun lifts up his head,</li>
  <li class="number">But like a fading taper, dim and dead?</li>
  <li class="number">My love shall brave the eye of heaven at noon,</li>
  <li class="number">And, being unmasked, outshine the golden sun.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LODOWICK.">
  <li class="number">What is the other fault, my sovereign lord?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD.">
  <li class="number">Read o’er the line again.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LODOWICK.">
  <li class="number"><recite>“More fair and chaste”—</recite></li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD.">
  <li class="number">I did not bid thee talk of chastity,</li>
  <li class="number">To ransack so the treasure of her mind;</li>
  <li class="number">For I had rather have her chased than chaste.</li>
  <li class="number">Out with the moon line, I will none of it;</li>
  <li class="number">And let me have her likened to the sun:</li>
  <li class="number">Say she hath thrice more splendor than the sun,</li>
  <li class="number">That her perfections emulate the sun,</li>
  <li class="number">That she breeds sweets as plenteous as the sun,</li>
  <li class="number">That she doth thaw cold winter like the sun,</li>
  <li class="number">That she doth cheer fresh summer like the sun,</li>
  <li class="number">The she doth dazzle gazers like the sun;</li>
  <li class="number">And, in this application to the sun,</li>
  <li class="number">Bid her be free and general as the sun,</li>
  <li class="number">Who smiles upon the basest weed that grows</li>
  <li class="number">As lovingly as on the fragrant rose.</li>
  <li class="number">Let’s see what follows that same moonlight line.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LODOWICK.">
  <li class="number">“More fair and chaste than is the queen of shades,</li>
  <li class="number">More bold in constance”—</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LODOWICK.">
  <li class="number">“Than Judith was.”</li>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD.">
  <li class="number">O monstrous line! Put in the next a sword,</li>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD.">
  <li class="number">I thank thee then; thou hast done little ill,</li>

  <li class="number">No, let the captain talk of boisterous war,</li>
  <li class="number">The prisoner of emured dark constraint,</li>
  <li class="number">The sick man best sets down the pangs of death,</li>
  <li class="number">The man that starves the sweetness of a feast,</li>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE EDWARD.">
  <li class="number">Successfully, I thank the gracious heavens:</li>
  <li class="number">Some of their strongest cities we have won,</li>
  <li class="number">As Harfleur, Lo, Crotay, and Carentigne,</li>

  <li class="number">Edward, know that John, the true king of France,</li>
  <li class="number">Musing thou shouldst encroach upon his land,</li>
  <li class="number">And in thy tyrannous proceeding slay</li>
  <li class="number">His faithful subjects and subvert his towns,</li>
  <li class="number">Spits in thy face; and in this manner following</li>
  <li class="number">Obraids thee with thine arrogant intrusion:</li>
  <li class="number">First, I condemn thee for a fugitive,</li>
  <li class="number">A thievish pirate, and a needy mate,</li>
  <li class="number">One that hath either no abiding place,</li>
  <li class="number">Or else, inhabiting some barren soil,</li>
  <li class="number">Where neither herb or fruitful grain is had,</li>
  <li class="number">Doest altogether live by pilfering:</li>
  <li class="number">Next, insomuch thou hast infringed thy faith,</li>
  <li class="number">Broke league and solemn covenant made with me,</li>
  <li class="number">I hold thee for a false pernicious wretch:</li>
  <li class="number">And, last of all, although I scorn to cope</li>
  <li class="number">With one so much inferior to myself,</li>
  <li class="number">Yet, in respect thy thirst is all for gold,</li>
  <li class="number">Thy labour rather to be feared than loved,</li>
  <li class="number">To satisfy thy lust in either part,</li>
  <li class="number">Here am I come, and with me have I brought</li>
  <li class="number">Exceeding store of treasure, pearl, and coin.</li>
  <li class="number">Leave, therefore, now to persecute the weak,</li>
  <li class="number">And armed entering conflict with the armed,</li>
  <li class="number">Let it be seen, ’mongst other petty thefts,</li>
  <li class="number">How thou canst win this pillage manfully.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD.">
  <li class="number">If gall or wormwood have a pleasant taste,</li>
  <li class="number">Then is thy salutation honey sweet;</li>
  <li class="number">But as the one hath no such property,</li>
  <li class="number">So is the other most satirical.</li>
  <li class="number">Yet wot how I regard thy worthless taunts:</li>
  <li class="number">If thou have uttered them to foil my fame</li>
  <li class="number">Or dim the reputation of my birth,</li>
  <li class="number">Know that thy wolvish barking cannot hurt;</li>
  <li class="number">If slyly to insinuate with the world,</li>
  <li class="number">And with a strumpet’s artificial line</li>
  <li class="number">To paint thy vicious and deformed cause,</li>
  <li class="number">Be well assured, the counterfeit will fade,</li>
  <li class="number">And in the end thy foul defects be seen;</li>
  <li class="number">But if thou didst it to provoke me on,</li>
  <li class="number">As who should say I were but timorous.</li>
  <li class="number">Or, coldly negligent, did need a spur,</li>
  <li class="number">Bethink thyself how slack I was at sea,</li>
  <li class="number">How since my landing I have won no towns,</li>
  <li class="number">Entered no further but upon the coast,</li>
  <li class="number">And there have ever since securely slept.</li>
  <li class="number">But if I have been other wise employed,</li>
  <li class="number">Imagine, Valois, whether I intend</li>
  <li class="number">To skirmish, not for pillage, but for the crown</li>
  <li class="number">Which thou dost wear; and that I vow to have,</li>
  <li class="number">Or one of us shall fall into his grave.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE EDWARD.">
  <li class="number">Look not for cross invectives at our hands,</li>
  <li class="number">Or railing execrations of despite:</li>
  <li class="number">Let creeping serpents, hid in hollow banks,</li>
  <li class="number">Sting with their tongues; we have remorseless swords,</li>
  <li class="number">And they shall plead for us and our affairs.</li>
  <li class="number">Yet thus much, briefly, by my father’s leave:</li>
  <li class="number">As all the immodest poison of thy throat</li>
  <li class="number">Is scandalous and most notorious lies,</li>
  <li class="number">And our pretended quarrel is truly just,</li>
  <li class="number">So end the battle when we meet today:</li>
  <li class="number">May either of us prosper and prevail,</li>
  <li class="number">Or, luckless, curst, receive eternal shame!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD.">
  <li class="number">That needs no further question; and I know,</li>
  <li class="number">His conscience witnesseth, it is my right.—</li>
  <li class="number">Therefore, Valois, say, wilt thou yet resign,</li>
  <li class="number">Before the sickles thrust into the corn,</li>
  <li class="number">Or that inkindled fury turn to flame?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING JOHN.">
  <li class="number">Edward, I know what right thou hast in France;</li>
  <li class="number">And ere I basely will resign my crown,</li>
  <li class="number">This champion field shall be a pool of blood,</li>
  <li class="number">And all our prospect as a slaughter house.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE EDWARD.">
  <li class="number">Aye, that approves thee, tyrant, what thou art:</li>
  <li class="number">No father, king, or shepherd of thy realm,</li>
  <li class="number">But one, that tears her entrails with thy hands,</li>
  <li class="number">And, like a thirsty tiger, suckst her blood.</li>
</ol>

  <li class="number">Know, these grave scholars of experience,</li>

  <li class="number">Lords and my loving subjects, now’s the time,</li>
  <li class="number">That your intended force must bide the touch.</li>
  <li class="number">Therefore, my friends, consider this in brief:</li>
  <li class="number">He that you fight for is your natural King;</li>
  <li class="number">He against whom you fight, a foreigner:</li>
  <li class="number">He that you fight for, rules in clemency,</li>
  <li class="number">And reins you with a mild and gentle bit;</li>
  <li class="number">He against whom you fight, if he prevail,</li>
  <li class="number">Will straight inthrone himself in tyranny,</li>
  <li class="number">Makes slaves of you, and with a heavy hand</li>
  <li class="number">Curtail and curb your sweetest liberty.</li>
  <li class="number">Then, to protect your country and your King,</li>
  <li class="number">Let but the haughty courage of your hearts</li>
  <li class="number">Answer the number of your able hands,</li>
  <li class="number">And we shall quickly chase these fugitives.</li>
  <li class="number">For what’s this Edward but a belly god,</li>
  <li class="number">A tender and lascivious wantoness,</li>
  <li class="number">That thother day was almost dead for love?</li>
  <li class="number">And what, I pray you, is his goodly guard?</li>
  <li class="number">Such as, but scant them of their chines of beef</li>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE EDWARD.">
  <li class="number">Audley, the arms of death embrace us round,</li>
  <li class="number">And comfort have we none, save that to die</li>
  <li class="number">We pay sower earnest for a sweeter life.</li>
  <li class="number">At Cressy’s field out clouds of warlike smoke</li>
  <li class="number">Choked up those French mouths and dissevered them;</li>
  <li class="number">But now their multitudes of millions hide,</li>
  <li class="number">Masking as twere, the beauteous burning sun,</li>
  <li class="number">Leaving no hope to us, but sullen dark</li>
  <li class="number">And eyeless terror of all ending night.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="AUDLEY.">
  <li class="number">This sudden, mighty, and expedient head</li>
  <li class="number">That they have made, fair prince, is wonderful.</li>
  <li class="number">Before us in the valley lies the king,</li>
  <li class="number">Vantaged with all that heaven and earth can yield;</li>
  <li class="number">His party stronger battled than our whole:</li>
  <li class="number">His son, the braving Duke of Normandy,</li>
  <li class="number">Hath trimmed the mountain on our right hand up</li>
  <li class="number">In shining plate, that now the aspiring hill</li>
  <li class="number">Shews like a silver quarry or an orb,</li>
  <li class="number">Aloft the which the banners, bannarets,</li>
  <li class="number">And new replenished pendants cuff the air</li>
  <li class="number">And beat the winds, that for their gaudiness</li>
  <li class="number">Struggles to kiss them: on our left hand lies</li>
  <li class="number">Philip, the younger issue of the king,</li>
  <li class="number">Coating the other hill in such array,</li>
  <li class="number">That all his guilded upright pikes do seem</li>
  <li class="number">Straight trees of gold, the pendants leaves;</li>
  <li class="number">And their device of antique heraldry,</li>
  <li class="number">Quartered in colors, seeming sundry fruits,</li>
  <li class="number">Makes it the orchard of the Hesperides:</li>
  <li class="number">Behind us too the hill doth bear his height,</li>
  <li class="number">For like a half-moon, opening but one way,</li>
  <li class="number">It rounds us in; there at our backs are lodged</li>
  <li class="number">The fatal crossbows, and the battle there</li>
  <li class="number">Is governed by the rough Chatillion.</li>
  <li class="number">Then thus it stands: the valley for our flight</li>
  <li class="number">The king binds in; the hills on either hand</li>
  <li class="number">Are proudly royalized by his sons;</li>
  <li class="number">And on the Hill behind stands certain death</li>
  <li class="number">In pay and service with Chatillion.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE EDWARD.">
  <li class="number">Death’s name is much more mighty than his deeds;</li>
  <li class="number">Thy parcelling this power hath made it more.</li>
  <li class="number">As many sands as these my hands can hold,</li>
  <li class="number">Are but my handful of so many sands;</li>
  <li class="number">Then, all the world, and call it but a power,</li>
  <li class="number">Easily ta’en up, and quickly thrown away:</li>
  <li class="number">But if I stand to count them sand by sand,</li>
  <li class="number">The number would confound my memory,</li>
  <li class="number">And make a thousand millions of a task,</li>
  <li class="number">Which briefly is no more, indeed, than one.</li>
  <li class="number">These quarters, squadrons, and these regiments,</li>
  <li class="number">Before, behind us, and on either hand,</li>
  <li class="number">Are but a power. When we name a man,</li>
  <li class="number">His hand, his foot, his head hath several strengths;</li>
  <li class="number">And being all but one self instant strength,</li>
  <li class="number">Why, all this many, Audley, is but one,</li>
  <li class="number">And we can call it all but one man’s strength.</li>
  <li class="number">He that hath far to go, tells it by miles;</li>
  <li class="number">If he should tell the steps, it kills his heart:</li>
  <li class="number">The drops are infinite, that make a flood,</li>
  <li class="number">And yet, thou knowest, we call it but a Rain.</li>
  <li class="number">There is but one France, one King of France,</li>
  <li class="number">That France hath no more kings; and that same King</li>
  <li class="number">Hath but the puissant legion of one king,</li>
  <li class="number">And we have one: then apprehend no odds,</li>
  <li class="number">For one to one is fair equality.</li>

  <li class="number">So intricate the dark confusion was,</li>
  <li class="number">Away we turned our watery eyes with sighs,</li>
  <li class="number">As black as powder fuming into smoke.</li>
  <li class="number">And thus, I fear, unhappy have I told</li>
  <li class="number">The most untimely tale of Edward’s fall.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUEEN PHILIP.">
  <li class="number">Ah me, is this my welcome into France?</li>
  <li class="number">Is this the comfort that I looked to have,</li>
  <li class="number">When I should meet with my beloved son?</li>
  <li class="number">Sweet Ned, I would thy mother in the sea</li>
  <li class="number">Had been prevented of this mortal grief!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD.">
  <li class="number">Content thee, Philip; ’tis not tears will serve</li>
  <li class="number">To call him back, if he be taken hence:</li>
  <li class="number">Comfort thyself, as I do, gentle Queen,</li>
  <li class="number">With hope of sharp, unheard of, dire revenge.—</li>
  <li class="number">He bids me to provide his funeral,</li>
  <li class="number">And so I will; but all the peers in France</li>
  <li class="number">Shall mourners be, and weep out bloody tears,</li>
  <li class="number">Until their empty veins be dry and sere:</li>
  <li class="number">The pillars of his hearse shall be his bones;</li>
  <li class="number">The mould that covers him, their city ashes;</li>
  <li class="number">His knell, the groaning cries of dying men;</li>
  <li class="number">And, in the stead of tapers on his tomb,</li>
  <li class="number">An hundred fifty towers shall burning blaze,</li>
  <li class="number">While we bewail our valiant son’s decease.</li>

  <li class="number">Rejoice, my lord; ascend the imperial throne!</li>
  <li class="number">The mighty and redoubted prince of Wales,</li>
  <li class="number">Great servitor to bloody Mars in arms,</li>
  <li class="number">The Frenchman’s terror, and his country’s fame,</li>
  <li class="number">Triumphant rideth like a Roman peer,</li>
  <li class="number">And, lowly at his stirrup, comes afoot</li>

  <li class="number">In captive bonds; whose diadem he brings</li>
  <li class="number">To crown thee with, and to proclaim thee king.</li>

  <li class="number">Away with mourning, Philip, wipe thine eyes;—</li>

  <li class="number">As things long lost, when they are found again,</li>

</li>
  <li class="number">For inward passion will not let me speak.</li>

  <li class="number">My gracious father, here receive the gift.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">
	Presenting him with King John’s crown.
	
		PRINCE EDWARD.
		KING EDWARD.
	
</li>
  <li class="number">This wreath of conquest and reward of war,</li>
  <li class="number">Got with as mickle peril of our lives,</li>
  <li class="number">As ere was thing of price before this day;</li>
  <li class="number">Install your highness in your proper right:</li>
  <li class="number">And, herewithall, I render to your hands</li>
  <li class="number">These prisoners, chief occasion of our strife.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD.">
  <li class="number">So, John of France, I see you keep your word:</li>
  <li class="number">You promised to be sooner with our self</li>
  <li class="number">Than we did think for, and ’tis so indeed:</li>
  <li class="number">But, had you done at first as now you do,</li>
  <li class="number">How many civil towns had stood untouched,</li>
  <li class="number">That now are turned to ragged heaps of stones!</li>
  <li class="number">How many people’s lives mightst thou have saved,</li>
  <li class="number">That are untimely sunk into their graves!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING JOHN.">
  <li class="number">Edward, recount not things irrevocable;</li>
  <li class="number">Tell me what ransom thou requirest to have.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD.">
  <li class="number">Thy ransom, John, hereafter shall be known:</li>
  <li class="number">But first to England thou must cross the seas,</li>
  <li class="number">To see what entertainment it affords;</li>
  <li class="number">How ere it falls, it cannot be so bad,</li>
  <li class="number">As ours hath been since we arrived in France.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING JOHN.">
  <li class="number">Accursed man! Of this I was foretold,</li>
  <li class="number">But did misconster what the prophet told.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE EDWARD.">
  <li class="number">Now, father, this petition Edward makes</li>
  <li class="number">To thee, whose grace hath been his strongest shield,</li>
  <li class="number">That, as thy pleasure chose me for the man</li>
  <li class="number">To be the instrument to shew thy power,</li>
  <li class="number">So thou wilt grant that many princes more,</li>
  <li class="number">Bred and brought up within that little Isle,</li>
  <li class="number">May still be famous for like victories!</li>
  <li class="number">And, for my part, the bloody scars I bear,</li>
  <li class="number">And weary nights that I have watched in field,</li>
  <li class="number">The dangerous conflicts I have often had,</li>
  <li class="number">The fearful menaces were proffered me,</li>
  <li class="number">The heat and cold and what else might displease:</li>
  <li class="number">I wish were now redoubled twenty fold,</li>
  <li class="number">So that hereafter ages, when they read</li>
  <li class="number">The painful traffic of my tender youth,</li>
  <li class="number">Might thereby be inflamed with such resolve,</li>
  <li class="number">As not the territories of France alone,</li>
  <li class="number">But likewise Spain, Turkey, and what countries else</li>
  <li class="number">That justly would provoke fair England’s ire,</li>
  <li class="number">Might, at their presence, tremble and retire.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING EDWARD.">
  <li class="number">Here, English lords, we do proclaim a rest,</li>
  <li class="number">An intercession of our painful arms:</li>
  <li class="number">Sheath up your swords, refresh your weary limbs,</li>
  <li class="number">Peruse your spoils; and, after we have breathed</li>
  <li class="number">A day or two within this haven town,</li>
  <li class="number">God willing, then for England we’ll be shipped;</li>
  <li class="number">Where, in a happy hour, I trust, we shall</li>
  <li class="number">Arrive, three kings, two princes, and a queen.</li>
