  <li class="number">I wonder how the King escap’d our hands.</li>

<ol data-speaker="YORK.">
  <li class="number">While we pursu’d the horsemen of the north,</li>
  <li class="number">He slyly stole away and left his men;</li>
  <li class="number">Whereat the great Lord of Northumberland,</li>
  <li class="number">Whose warlike ears could never brook retreat,</li>
  <li class="number">Cheer’d up the drooping army, and himself,</li>
  <li class="number">Lord Clifford, and Lord Stafford, all abreast,</li>
  <li class="number">Charg’d our main battle’s front; and breaking in,</li>
  <li class="number">Were by the swords of common soldiers slain.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="EDW.">
  <li class="number">Lord Stafford’s father, Duke of Buckingham,</li>
  <li class="number">Is either slain or wounded dangerous;</li>
  <li class="number">I cleft his beaver with a downright blow.</li>
  <li class="number">That this is true, father, behold his blood.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MONT.">
  <li class="number">And, brother, here’s the Earl of Wiltshire’s blood,</li>
  <li class="number">Whom I encount’red as the battles join’d.</li>

<ol data-speaker="RICH.">
  <li class="number">Thus do I hope to shake King Henry’s head.</li>

<ol data-speaker="WAR.">
  <li class="number">And so do I, victorious prince of York.</li>
  <li class="number">Before I see thee seated in that throne</li>
  <li class="number">Which now the house of Lancaster usurps,</li>
  <li class="number">I vow by heaven these eyes shall never close.</li>
  <li class="number">This is the palace of the fearful king,</li>
  <li class="number">And this the regal seat. Possess it, York,</li>
  <li class="number">For this is thine and not King Henry’s heirs’.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="YORK.">
  <li class="number">Assist me then, sweet Warwick, and I will,</li>

  <li class="number">Hath made us by-words to our enemies.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="YORK.">
  <li class="number">Then leave me not, my lords, be resolute,</li>

  <li class="number">My lords, look where the sturdy rebel sits,</li>
  <li class="number">Even in the chair of state. Belike he means,</li>
  <li class="number">Back’d by the power of Warwick, that false peer,</li>
  <li class="number">To aspire unto the crown and reign as king.</li>
  <li class="number">Earl of Northumberland, he slew thy father,</li>
  <li class="number">And thine, Lord Clifford, and you both have vow’d revenge</li>
  <li class="number">On him, his sons, his favorites, and his friends.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NORTH.">
  <li class="number">If I be not, heavens be reveng’d on me!</li>

<ol data-speaker="CLIF.">
  <li class="number">The hope thereof makes Clifford mourn in steel.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WEST.">
  <li class="number">What, shall we suffer this? Let’s pluck him down.</li>
  <li class="number">My heart for anger burns, I cannot brook it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="K. HEN.">
  <li class="number">Be patient, gentle Earl of Westmorland.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLIF.">
  <li class="number">Patience is for poltroons, such as he.</li>
  <li class="number">He durst not sit there, had your father liv’d.</li>
  <li class="number">My gracious lord, here in the parliament</li>
  <li class="number">Let us assail the family of York.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NORTH.">
  <li class="number">Well hast thou spoken, cousin, be it so.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="K. HEN.">
  <li class="number">Ah, know you not the city favors them,</li>
  <li class="number">And they have troops of soldiers at their beck?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="EXE.">
  <li class="number">But when the Duke is slain, they’ll quickly fly.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="K. HEN.">
  <li class="number">Far be the thought of this from Henry’s heart,</li>
  <li class="number">To make a shambles of the parliament house!</li>
  <li class="number">Cousin of Exeter, frowns, words, and threats</li>
  <li class="number">Shall be the war that Henry means to use.</li>
  <li class="number">Thou factious Duke of York, descend my throne,</li>
  <li class="number">And kneel for grace and mercy at my feet:</li>
  <li class="number">I am thy sovereign.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="YORK.">
  <li class="number">I am thine.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="EXE.">
  <li class="number">For shame, come down. He made thee Duke of York.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="YORK.">
  <li class="number">It was my inheritance, as the earldom was.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="EXE.">
  <li class="number">Thy father was a traitor to the crown.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WAR.">
  <li class="number">Exeter, thou art a traitor to the crown,</li>
  <li class="number">In following this usurping Henry.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLIF.">
  <li class="number">Whom should he follow but his natural king?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WAR.">
  <li class="number">True, Clifford, that’s Richard Duke of York.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="K. HEN.">
  <li class="number">And shall I stand, and thou sit in my throne?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="YORK.">
  <li class="number">It must and shall be so. Content thyself.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WAR.">
  <li class="number">Be Duke of Lancaster, let him be King.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WEST.">
  <li class="number">He is both King and Duke of Lancaster,</li>
  <li class="number">And that the Lord of Westmorland shall maintain.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WAR.">
  <li class="number">And Warwick shall disprove it. You forget</li>
  <li class="number">That we are those which chas’d you from the field,</li>
  <li class="number">And slew your fathers, and with colors spread</li>
  <li class="number">March’d through the city to the palace gates.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NORTH.">
  <li class="number">Yes, Warwick, I remember it to my grief,</li>
  <li class="number">And by his soul, thou and thy house shall rue it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WEST.">
  <li class="number">Plantagenet, of thee and these thy sons,</li>
  <li class="number">Thy kinsmen and thy friends, I’ll have more lives</li>
  <li class="number">Than drops of blood were in my father’s veins.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLIF.">
  <li class="number">Urge it no more, lest that, in stead of words,</li>
  <li class="number">I send thee, Warwick, such a messenger</li>
  <li class="number">As shall revenge his death before I stir.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WAR.">
  <li class="number">Poor Clifford, how I scorn his worthless threats!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="YORK.">
  <li class="number">Will you we show our title to the crown?</li>
  <li class="number">If not, our swords shall plead it in the field.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="K. HEN.">
  <li class="number">What title hast thou, traitor, to the crown?</li>
  <li class="number">Thy father was, as thou art, Duke of York,</li>
  <li class="number">Thy grandfather, Roger Mortimer, Earl of March:</li>
  <li class="number">I am the son of Henry the Fifth,</li>
  <li class="number">Who made the Dauphin and the French to stoop,</li>
  <li class="number">And seiz’d upon their towns and provinces.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WAR.">
  <li class="number">Talk not of France, sith thou hast lost it all.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="K. HEN.">
  <li class="number">The Lord Protector lost it, and not I;</li>
  <li class="number">When I was crown’d I was but nine months old.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="RICH.">
  <li class="number">You are old enough now, and yet methinks you lose.</li>
  <li class="number">Father, tear the crown from the usurper’s head.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="EDW.">
  <li class="number">Sweet father, do so, set it on your head.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MONT.">
  <li class="number">Good brother, as thou lov’st and honorest arms,</li>
  <li class="number">Let’s fight it out, and not stand cavilling thus.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="RICH.">
  <li class="number">Sound drums and trumpets, and the King will fly.</li>

<ol data-speaker="YORK.">
  <li class="number">Sons, peace!</li>

<ol data-speaker="K. HEN.">
  <li class="number">Peace thou! And give King Henry leave to speak.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WAR.">
  <li class="number">Plantagenet shall speak first. Hear him, lords,</li>
  <li class="number">And be you silent and attentive too,</li>
  <li class="number">For he that interrupts him shall not live.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="K. HEN.">
  <li class="number">Think’st thou that I will leave my kingly throne,</li>
  <li class="number">Wherein my grandsire and my father sat?</li>
  <li class="number">No; first shall war unpeople this my realm;</li>
  <li class="number">Ay, and their colors, often borne in France,</li>
  <li class="number">And now in England to our heart’s great sorrow,</li>
  <li class="number">Shall be my winding-sheet. Why faint you, lords?</li>
  <li class="number">My title’s good, and better far than his.</li>

  <li class="number">What then?</li>

<ol data-speaker="K. HEN.">
  <li class="number">And if he may, then am I lawful king;</li>

  <li class="number">Whose heir my father was, and I am his.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="YORK.">
  <li class="number">He rose against him, being his sovereign,</li>

  <li class="number">’Tis beauty that doth oft make women proud,</li>

  <li class="number">How couldst thou drain the life-blood of the child,</li>
  <li class="number">To bid the father wipe his eyes withal,</li>
  <li class="number">And yet be seen to wear a woman’s face?</li>
  <li class="number">Women are soft, mild, pitiful, and flexible;</li>
  <li class="number">Thou stern, obdurate, flinty, rough, remorseless.</li>
  <li class="number">Bid’st thou me rage? Why, now thou hast thy wish:</li>
  <li class="number">Wouldst have me weep? Why, now thou hast thy will:</li>
  <li class="number">For raging wind blows up incessant showers,</li>
  <li class="number">And when the rage allays, the rain begins.</li>
  <li class="number">These tears are my sweet Rutland’s obsequies,</li>
  <li class="number">And every drop cries vengeance for his death</li>

  <li class="number">Our baleful news, and at each word’s deliverance</li>
  <li class="number">Stab poniards in our flesh till all were told,</li>
  <li class="number">The words would add more anguish than the wounds.</li>

<ol data-speaker="EDW.">
  <li class="number">O Warwick, Warwick, that Plantagenet,</li>
  <li class="number">Which held thee dearly as his soul’s redemption,</li>
  <li class="number">Is by the stern Lord Clifford done to death.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WAR.">
  <li class="number">Ten days ago I drown’d these news in tears;</li>
  <li class="number">And now, to add more measure to your woes,</li>
  <li class="number">I come to tell you things sith then befall’n.</li>
  <li class="number">After the bloody fray at Wakefield fought,</li>
  <li class="number">Where your brave father breath’d his latest gasp,</li>
  <li class="number">Tidings, as swiftly as the posts could run,</li>
  <li class="number">Were brought me of your loss and his depart.</li>
  <li class="number">I, then in London, keeper of the King,</li>
  <li class="number">Muster’d my soldiers, gathered flocks of friends,</li>
  <li class="number">And very well appointed, as I thought,</li>
  <li class="number">March’d toward Saint Albans to intercept the Queen,</li>
  <li class="number">Bearing the King in my behalf along;</li>
  <li class="number">For by my scouts I was advertised</li>
  <li class="number">That she was coming with a full intent</li>
  <li class="number">To dash our late decree in parliament</li>
  <li class="number">Touching King Henry’s oath and your succession.</li>
  <li class="number">Short tale to make, we at Saint Albans met,</li>
  <li class="number">Our battles join’d, and both sides fiercely fought;</li>
  <li class="number">But whether ’twas the coldness of the King,</li>
  <li class="number">Who look’d full gently on his warlike queen,</li>
  <li class="number">That robb’d my soldiers of their heated spleen;</li>
  <li class="number">Or whether ’twas report of her success,</li>
  <li class="number">Or more than common fear of Clifford’s rigor,</li>
  <li class="number">Who thunders to his captives blood and death,</li>
  <li class="number">I cannot judge: but, to conclude with truth,</li>
  <li class="number">Their weapons like to lightning came and went;</li>
  <li class="number">Our soldiers’, like the night-owl’s lazy flight,</li>
  <li class="number">Or like an idle thresher with a flail,</li>
  <li class="number">Fell gently down, as if they struck their friends.</li>
  <li class="number">I cheer’d them up with justice of our cause,</li>
  <li class="number">With promise of high pay and great rewards;</li>
  <li class="number">But all in vain, they had no heart to fight,</li>
  <li class="number">And we, in them, no hope to win the day,</li>
  <li class="number">So that we fled: the King unto the Queen;</li>
  <li class="number">Lord George your brother, Norfolk, and myself,</li>
  <li class="number">In haste, post-haste, are come to join with you;</li>
  <li class="number">For in the marches here we heard you were,</li>
  <li class="number">Making another head to fight again.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="EDW.">
  <li class="number">Where is the Duke of Norfolk, gentle Warwick?</li>
  <li class="number">And when came George from Burgundy to England?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WAR.">
  <li class="number">Some six miles off the Duke is with the soldiers,</li>
  <li class="number">And for your brother, he was lately sent</li>
  <li class="number">From your kind aunt, Duchess of Burgundy,</li>
  <li class="number">With aid of soldiers to this needful war.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="RICH.">
  <li class="number">’Twas odds, belike, when valiant Warwick fled:</li>
  <li class="number">Oft have I heard his praises in pursuit,</li>
  <li class="number">But ne’er till now his scandal of retire.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WAR.">
  <li class="number">Nor now my scandal, Richard, dost thou hear;</li>
  <li class="number">For thou shalt know this strong right hand of mine</li>
  <li class="number">Can pluck the diadem from faint Henry’s head,</li>
  <li class="number">And wring the aweful sceptre from his fist,</li>
  <li class="number">Were he as famous and as bold in war</li>
  <li class="number">As he is fam’d for mildness, peace, and prayer.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="RICH.">
  <li class="number">I know it well, Lord Warwick, blame me not.</li>
  <li class="number">’Tis love I bear thy glories make me speak.</li>
  <li class="number">But in this troublous time what’s to be done?</li>
  <li class="number">Shall we go throw away our coats of steel,</li>
  <li class="number">And wrap our bodies in black mourning gowns,</li>
  <li class="number">Numb’ring our Ave-Maries with our beads?</li>
  <li class="number">Or shall we on the helmets of our foes</li>
  <li class="number">Tell our devotion with revengeful arms?</li>
  <li class="number">If for the last, say ay, and to it, lords.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WAR.">
  <li class="number">Why, therefore Warwick came to seek you out,</li>
  <li class="number">And therefore comes my brother Montague.</li>
  <li class="number">Attend me, lords: the proud insulting Queen,</li>
  <li class="number">With Clifford and the haught Northumberland,</li>
  <li class="number">And of their feather many more proud birds,</li>
  <li class="number">Have wrought the easy-melting King like wax.</li>
  <li class="number">He swore consent to your succession,</li>
  <li class="number">His oath enrolled in the parliament;</li>
  <li class="number">And now to London all the crew are gone</li>
  <li class="number">To frustrate both his oath and what beside</li>
  <li class="number">May make against the house of Lancaster.</li>
  <li class="number">Their power, I think, is thirty thousand strong.</li>
  <li class="number">Now, if the help of Norfolk and myself,</li>
  <li class="number">With all the friends that thou, brave Earl of March,</li>
  <li class="number">Amongst the loving Welshmen canst procure,</li>
  <li class="number">Will but amount to five and twenty thousand,</li>
  <li class="number">Why, <foreign xml:lang="it">via</foreign>! To London will we march,</li>
  <li class="number">And once again bestride our foaming steeds,</li>
  <li class="number">And once again cry “Charge!” upon our foes,</li>
  <li class="number">But never once again turn back and fly.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="RICH.">
  <li class="number">Ay, now methinks I hear great Warwick speak.</li>
  <li class="number">Ne’er may he live to see a sunshine day</li>
  <li class="number">That cries “Retire!” if Warwick bid him stay.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="EDW.">
  <li class="number">Lord Warwick, on thy shoulder will I lean,</li>
  <li class="number">And when thou fail’st (as God forbid the hour!)</li>
  <li class="number">Must Edward fall, which peril heaven forefend!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WAR.">
  <li class="number">No longer Earl of March, but Duke of York;</li>
  <li class="number">The next degree is England’s royal throne;</li>
  <li class="number">For King of England shalt thou be proclaim’d</li>
  <li class="number">In every borough as we pass along,</li>
  <li class="number">And he that throws not up his cap for joy</li>
  <li class="number">Shall for the fault make forfeit of his head.</li>
  <li class="number">King Edward, valiant Richard, Montague,</li>
  <li class="number">Stay we no longer, dreaming of renown,</li>
  <li class="number">But sound the trumpets, and about our task.</li>

<ol data-speaker="RICH.">
  <li class="number">Then, Clifford, were thy heart as hard as steel,</li>

  <li class="number">O Lancaster! I fear thy overthrow</li>
  <li class="number">More than my body’s parting with my soul.</li>
  <li class="number">My love and fear glu’d many friends to thee,</li>
  <li class="number">And now I fall, thy tough commixtures melts,</li>

  <li class="number">O Phoebus! Hadst thou never given consent</li>
  <li class="number">That Phaëton should check thy fiery steeds,</li>
  <li class="number">Thy burning car never had scorch’d the earth.</li>
  <li class="number">And, Henry, hadst thou sway’d as kings should do,</li>

  <li class="number">Giving no ground unto the house of York,</li>
  <li class="number">They never then had sprung like summer flies;</li>

  <li class="number">Bootless are plaints, and cureless are my wounds;</li>
  <li class="number">No way to fly, nor strength to hold out flight.</li>
  <li class="number">The foe is merciless, and will not pity;</li>
  <li class="number">For at their hands I have deserv’d no pity.</li>

  <li class="number">Hath plac’d thy beauty’s image and thy virtue.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="Q. MAR.">
  <li class="number">King Lewis and Lady Bona, hear me speak</li>
  <li class="number">Before you answer Warwick. His demand</li>
  <li class="number">Springs not from Edward’s well-meant honest love,</li>
  <li class="number">But from deceit bred by necessity;</li>
  <li class="number">For how can tyrants safely govern home,</li>
  <li class="number">Unless abroad they purchase great alliance?</li>
  <li class="number">To prove him tyrant this reason may suffice,</li>
  <li class="number">That Henry liveth still; but were he dead,</li>
  <li class="number">Yet here Prince Edward stands, King Henry’s son.</li>
  <li class="number">Look therefore, Lewis, that by this league and marriage</li>
  <li class="number">Thou draw not on thy danger and dishonor;</li>
  <li class="number">For though usurpers sway the rule a while,</li>
  <li class="number">Yet heav’ns are just, and time suppresseth wrongs.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WAR.">
  <li class="number">Injurious Margaret!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE.">
  <li class="number">And why not Queen?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WAR.">
  <li class="number">Because thy father Henry did usurp,</li>
  <li class="number">And thou no more art prince than she is queen.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OXF.">
  <li class="number">Then Warwick disannuls great John of Gaunt,</li>
  <li class="number">Which did subdue the greatest part of Spain;</li>
  <li class="number">And after John of Gaunt, Henry the Fourth,</li>
  <li class="number">Whose wisdom was a mirror to the wisest;</li>
  <li class="number">And after that wise prince, Henry the Fifth,</li>
  <li class="number">Who by his prowess conquered all France:</li>
  <li class="number">From these our Henry lineally descends.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WAR.">
  <li class="number">Oxford, how haps it in this smooth discourse</li>
  <li class="number">You told not how Henry the Sixth hath lost</li>
  <li class="number">All that which Henry the Fifth had gotten?</li>
  <li class="number">Methinks these peers of France should smile at that.</li>
  <li class="number">But for the rest: you tell a pedigree</li>
  <li class="number">Of threescore and two years—a silly time</li>
  <li class="number">To make prescription for a kingdom’s worth.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OXF.">
  <li class="number">Why, Warwick, canst thou speak against thy liege,</li>
  <li class="number">Whom thou obey’dst thirty and six years,</li>
  <li class="number">And not bewray thy treason with a blush?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WAR.">
  <li class="number">Can Oxford, that did ever fence the right,</li>
  <li class="number">Now buckler falsehood with a pedigree?</li>
  <li class="number">For shame, leave Henry, and call Edward king.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OXF.">
  <li class="number">Call him my king by whose injurious doom</li>
  <li class="number">My elder brother, the Lord Aubrey Vere,</li>
  <li class="number">Was done to death? And more than so, my father,</li>
  <li class="number">Even in the downfall of his mellow’d years,</li>
  <li class="number">When nature brought him to the door of death?</li>
  <li class="number">No, Warwick, no; while life upholds this arm,</li>
  <li class="number">This arm upholds the house of Lancaster.</li>
</ol>

  <li class="number">He was the author, thou the instrument.</li>
  <li class="number">Therefore that I may conquer fortune’s spite</li>
  <li class="number">By living low, where fortune cannot hurt me,</li>
  <li class="number">And that the people of this blessed land</li>
  <li class="number">May not be punish’d with my thwarting stars,</li>
  <li class="number">Warwick, although my head still wear the crown,</li>
  <li class="number">I here resign my government to thee,</li>

<ol data-speaker="WAR.">
  <li class="number">Your Grace hath still been fam’d for virtuous,</li>

<ol data-speaker="CLAR.">
  <li class="number">No, Warwick, thou art worthy of the sway,</li>

  <li class="number">Adjudg’d an olive branch and laurel crown,</li>

  <li class="number">And therefore I yield thee my free consent.</li>

<ol data-speaker="K. HEN.">
  <li class="number">Warwick and Clarence, give me both your hands.</li>

  <li class="number">That no dissension hinder government.</li>
  <li class="number">I make you both Protectors of this land,</li>
  <li class="number">While I myself will lead a private life,</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WAR.">
  <li class="number">What answers Clarence to his sovereign’s will?</li>

<ol data-speaker="WAR.">
  <li class="number">Why then, though loath, yet must I be content.</li>
  <li class="number">We’ll yoke together like a double shadow</li>

  <li class="number">I mean, in bearing weight of government,</li>

  <li class="number">The midwife wonder’d and the women cried,</li>
  <li class="number">“O, Jesus bless us, he is born with teeth!”</li>
  <li class="number">And so I was, which plainly signified</li>
  <li class="number">That I should snarl, and bite, and play the dog.</li>
  <li class="number">Then since the heavens have shap’d my body so,</li>
  <li class="number">Let hell make crook’d my mind to answer it.</li>
  <li class="number">I have no brother, I am like no brother;</li>

  <li class="number">Clarence, beware! Thou keep’st me from the light,</li>
