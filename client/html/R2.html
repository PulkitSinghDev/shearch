<ol data-speaker="K. RICH.">
  <li class="number">Old John of Gaunt, time-honored Lancaster,</li>
  <li class="number">Hast thou, according to thy oath and band,</li>
  <li class="number">Brought hither Henry Herford thy bold son,</li>
  <li class="number">Here to make good the boist’rous late appeal,</li>
  <li class="number">Which then our leisure would not let us hear,</li>
  <li class="number">Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GAUNT.">
  <li class="number">I have, my liege.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="K. RICH.">
  <li class="number">Tell me, moreover, hast thou sounded him,</li>
  <li class="number">If he appeal the Duke on ancient malice,</li>
  <li class="number">Or worthily, as a good subject should,</li>
  <li class="number">On some known ground of treachery in him?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GAUNT.">
  <li class="number">As near as I could sift him on that argument,</li>
  <li class="number">On some apparent danger seen in him</li>
  <li class="number">Aim’d at your Highness, no inveterate malice.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="K. RICH.">
  <li class="number">Then call them to our presence; face to face,</li>
  <li class="number">And frowning brow to brow, ourselves will hear</li>
  <li class="number">The accuser and the accused freely speak.</li>
  <li class="number">High-stomach’d are they both and full of ire,</li>
  <li class="number">In rage, deaf as the sea, hasty as fire.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">
	Enter Bullingbrook and Mowbray with Attendants.

<ol data-speaker="BULL.">
  <li class="number">Many years of happy days befall</li>
  <li class="number">My gracious sovereign, my most loving liege!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOW.">
  <li class="number">Each day still better other’s happiness,</li>
  <li class="number">Until the heavens, envying earth’s good hap,</li>
  <li class="number">Add an immortal title to your crown!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="K. RICH.">
  <li class="number">We thank you both, yet one but flatters us,</li>
  <li class="number">As well appeareth by the cause you come:</li>
  <li class="number">Namely, to appeal each other of high treason.</li>
  <li class="number">Cousin of Herford, what dost thou object</li>
  <li class="number">Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BULL.">
  <li class="number">First, heaven be the record to my speech,</li>
  <li class="number">In the devotion of a subject’s love,</li>
  <li class="number">Tend’ring the precious safety of my prince,</li>
  <li class="number">And free from other misbegotten hate,</li>
  <li class="number">Come I appellant to this princely presence.</li>
  <li class="number">Now, Thomas Mowbray, do I turn to thee,</li>
  <li class="number">And mark my greeting well; for what I speak</li>
  <li class="number">My body shall make good upon this earth,</li>
  <li class="number">Or my divine soul answer it in heaven.</li>
  <li class="number">Thou art a traitor and a miscreant,</li>
  <li class="number">Too good to be so, and too bad to live,</li>
  <li class="number">Since the more fair and crystal is the sky,</li>
  <li class="number">The uglier seem the clouds that in it fly.</li>
  <li class="number">Once more, the more to aggravate the note,</li>
  <li class="number">With a foul traitor’s name stuff I thy throat,</li>
  <li class="number">And wish (so please my sovereign) ere I move,</li>
  <li class="number">What my tongue speaks, my right drawn sword may prove.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOW.">
  <li class="number">Let not my cold words here accuse my zeal.</li>
  <li class="number">’Tis not the trial of a woman’s war,</li>
  <li class="number">The bitter clamor of two eager tongues,</li>
  <li class="number">Can arbitrate this cause betwixt us twain;</li>
  <li class="number">The blood is hot that must be cool’d for this.</li>
  <li class="number">Yet can I not of such tame patience boast</li>
  <li class="number">As to be hush’d and nought at all to say.</li>
  <li class="number">First, the fair reverence of your Highness curbs me</li>
  <li class="number">From giving reins and spurs to my free speech,</li>
  <li class="number">Which else would post until it had return’d</li>
  <li class="number">These terms of treason doubled down his throat.</li>
  <li class="number">Setting aside his high blood’s royalty,</li>
  <li class="number">And let him be no kinsman to my liege,</li>
  <li class="number">I do defy him, and I spit at him,</li>
  <li class="number">Call him a slanderous coward, and a villain,</li>
  <li class="number">Which to maintain I would allow him odds</li>
  <li class="number">And meet him, were I tied to run afoot</li>
  <li class="number">Even to the frozen ridges of the Alps,</li>
  <li class="number">Or any other ground inhabitable</li>
  <li class="number">Where ever Englishman durst set his foot.</li>
  <li class="number">Mean time, let this defend my loyalty:</li>
  <li class="number">By all my hopes, most falsely doth he lie.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BULL.">
  <li class="number">Pale trembling coward, there I throw my gage,</li>
  <li class="number">Disclaiming here the kindred of the King,</li>
  <li class="number">And lay aside my high blood’s royalty,</li>
  <li class="number">Which fear, not reverence, makes thee to except.</li>
  <li class="number">If guilty dread have left thee so much strength</li>
  <li class="number">As to take up mine honor’s pawn, then stoop.</li>
  <li class="number">By that, and all the rites of knighthood else,</li>
  <li class="number">Will I make good against thee, arm to arm,</li>
  <li class="number">What I have spoke, or thou canst worse devise.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOW.">
  <li class="number">I take it up, and by that sword I swear</li>
  <li class="number">Which gently laid my knighthood on my shoulder,</li>
  <li class="number">I’ll answer thee in any fair degree</li>
  <li class="number">Or chivalrous design of knightly trial;</li>
  <li class="number">And when I mount, alive may I not light,</li>
  <li class="number">If I be traitor or unjustly fight!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="K. RICH.">
  <li class="number">What doth our cousin lay to Mowbray’s charge?</li>
  <li class="number">It must be great that can inherit us</li>
  <li class="number">So much as of a thought of ill in him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BULL.">
  <li class="number">Look what I speak, my life shall prove it true:</li>
  <li class="number">That Mowbray hath receiv’d eight thousand nobles</li>
  <li class="number">In name of lendings for your Highness’ soldiers,</li>
  <li class="number">The which he hath detain’d for lewd employments,</li>
  <li class="number">Like a false traitor and injurious villain;</li>
  <li class="number">Besides I say, and will in battle prove,</li>
  <li class="number">Or here or elsewhere to the furthest verge</li>
  <li class="number">That ever was surveyed by English eye,</li>
  <li class="number">That all the treasons for these eighteen years,</li>
  <li class="number">Complotted and contrived in this land,</li>
  <li class="number">Fetch from false Mowbray their first head and spring.</li>
  <li class="number">Further I say, and further will maintain</li>
  <li class="number">Upon his bad life to make all this good,</li>
  <li class="number">That he did plot the Duke of Gloucester’s death,</li>
  <li class="number">Suggest his soon-believing adversaries,</li>
  <li class="number">And consequently, like a traitor coward,</li>
  <li class="number">Sluic’d out his innocent soul through streams of blood,</li>
  <li class="number">Which blood, like sacrificing Abel’s, cries,</li>
  <li class="number">Even from the tongueless caverns of the earth,</li>
  <li class="number">To me for justice and rough chastisement;</li>
  <li class="number">And, by the glorious worth of my descent,</li>
  <li class="number">This arm shall do it, or this life be spent.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="K. RICH.">
  <li class="number">How high a pitch his resolution soars!</li>
  <li class="number">Thomas of Norfolk, what say’st thou to this?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOW.">
  <li class="number">O, let my sovereign turn away his face,</li>
  <li class="number">And bid his ears a little while be deaf,</li>
  <li class="number">Till I have told this slander of his blood</li>
  <li class="number">How God and good men hate so foul a liar.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="K. RICH.">
  <li class="number">Mowbray, impartial are our eyes and ears.</li>
  <li class="number">Were he my brother, nay, my kingdom’s heir,</li>
  <li class="number">As he is but my father’s brother’s son,</li>
  <li class="number">Now by my sceptre’s awe I make a vow,</li>
  <li class="number">Such neighbor nearness to our sacred blood</li>
  <li class="number">Should nothing privilege him nor partialize</li>
  <li class="number">The unstooping firmness of my upright soul.</li>
  <li class="number">He is our subject, Mowbray; so art thou.</li>
  <li class="number">Free speech and fearless I to thee allow.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOW.">
  <li class="number">Then, Bullingbrook, as low as to thy heart</li>
  <li class="number">Through the false passage of thy throat thou liest.</li>
  <li class="number">Three parts of that receipt I had for Callice</li>
  <li class="number">Disburs’d I duly to his Highness’ soldiers;</li>
  <li class="number">The other part reserv’d I by consent,</li>
  <li class="number">For that my sovereign liege was in my debt,</li>
  <li class="number">Upon remainder of a dear account,</li>
  <li class="number">Since last I went to France to fetch his queen.</li>
  <li class="number">Now swallow down that lie. For Gloucester’s death,</li>
  <li class="number">I slew him not, but to my own disgrace</li>
  <li class="number">Neglected my sworn duty in that case.</li>
  <li class="number">For you, my noble Lord of Lancaster,</li>
  <li class="number">The honorable father to my foe,</li>
  <li class="number">Once did I lay an ambush for your life,</li>
  <li class="number">A trespass that doth vex my grieved soul;</li>
  <li class="number">But ere I last receiv’d the sacrament</li>
  <li class="number">I did confess it, and exactly begg’d</li>
  <li class="number">Your Grace’s pardon, and I hope I had it.</li>
  <li class="number">This is my fault. As for the rest appeal’d,</li>
  <li class="number">It issues from the rancor of a villain,</li>
  <li class="number">A recreant and most degenerate traitor,</li>
  <li class="number">Which in myself I boldly will defend,</li>
  <li class="number">And interchangeably hurl down my gage</li>
  <li class="number">Upon this overweening traitor’s foot,</li>
  <li class="number">To prove myself a loyal gentleman</li>
  <li class="number">Even in the best blood chamber’d in his bosom,</li>
  <li class="number">In haste whereof, most heartily I pray</li>
  <li class="number">Your Highness to assign our trial day.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="K. RICH.">
  <li class="number">Wrath-kindled gentlemen, be rul’d by me,</li>
  <li class="number">Let’s purge this choler without letting blood.</li>
  <li class="number">This we prescribe, though no physician;</li>
  <li class="number">Deep malice makes too deep incision.</li>
  <li class="number">Forget, forgive, conclude and be agreed,</li>
  <li class="number">Our doctors say this is no month to bleed.</li>
  <li class="number">Good uncle, let this end where it begun;</li>
  <li class="number">We’ll calm the Duke of Norfolk, you your son.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GAUNT.">
  <li class="number">To be a make-peace shall become my age.</li>
  <li class="number">Throw down, my son, the Duke of Norfolk’s gage.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="K. RICH.">
  <li class="number">And, Norfolk, throw down his.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GAUNT.">
  <li class="number">When, Harry? When?</li>
  <li class="number">Obedience bids I should not bid again.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="K. RICH.">
  <li class="number">Norfolk, throw down, we bid, there is no boot.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOW.">
  <li class="number">Myself I throw, dread sovereign, at thy foot,</li>
  <li class="number">My life thou shalt command, but not my shame:</li>
  <li class="number">The one my duty owes, but my fair name,</li>
  <li class="number">Despite of death that lives upon my grave,</li>
  <li class="number">To dark dishonor’s use thou shalt not have.</li>
  <li class="number">I am disgrac’d, impeach’d, and baffled here,</li>
  <li class="number">Pierc’d to the soul with slander’s venom’d spear,</li>
  <li class="number">The which no balm can cure but his heart-blood</li>
  <li class="number">Which breath’d this poison.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="K. RICH.">
  <li class="number">Rage must be withstood,</li>
  <li class="number">Give me his gage. Lions make leopards tame.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOW.">
  <li class="number">Yea, but not change his spots. Take but my shame,</li>
  <li class="number">And I resign my gage. My dear dear lord,</li>
  <li class="number">The purest treasure mortal times afford</li>
  <li class="number">Is spotless reputation; that away,</li>
  <li class="number">Men are but gilded loam or painted clay.</li>
  <li class="number">A jewel in a ten-times-barr’d-up chest</li>
  <li class="number">Is a bold spirit in a loyal breast.</li>
  <li class="number">Mine honor is my life, both grow in one,</li>
  <li class="number">Take honor from me, and my life is done.</li>
  <li class="number">Then, dear my liege, mine honor let me try;</li>
  <li class="number">In that I live, and for that will I die.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="K. RICH.">
  <li class="number">Cousin, throw up your gage, do you begin.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BULL.">
  <li class="number">O, God defend my soul from such deep sin!</li>
  <li class="number">Shall I seem crestfallen in my father’s sight?</li>
  <li class="number">Or with pale beggar-fear impeach my height</li>
  <li class="number">Before this outdar’d dastard? Ere my tongue</li>
  <li class="number">Shall wound my honor with such feeble wrong,</li>
  <li class="number">Or sound so base a parley, my teeth shall tear</li>
  <li class="number">The slavish motive of recanting fear,</li>
  <li class="number">And spit it bleeding in his high disgrace,</li>
  <li class="number">Where shame doth harbor, even in Mowbray’s face.</li>

<h3>Scene 2</h3>

<h4>The Duke of Lancaster’s palace.</h4>

<div class="stage-direction">
	Enter John of Gaunt with the Duchess of Gloucester.
	
		GAUNT.
		DUCH.
	
</div>

<ol data-speaker="GAUNT.">
  <li class="number">Alas, the part I had in Woodstock’s blood</li>
  <li class="number">Doth more solicit me than your exclaims</li>
  <li class="number">To stir against the butchers of his life!</li>
  <li class="number">But since correction lieth in those hands</li>
  <li class="number">Which made the fault that we cannot correct,</li>
  <li class="number">Put we our quarrel to the will of heaven,</li>
  <li class="number">Who, when they see the hour’s ripe on earth,</li>
  <li class="number">Will rain hot vengeance on offenders’ heads.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUCH.">
  <li class="number">Finds brotherhood in thee no sharper spur?</li>
  <li class="number">Hath love in thy old blood no living fire?</li>
  <li class="number">Edward’s seven sons, whereof thyself art one,</li>
  <li class="number">Were as seven vials of his sacred blood,</li>
  <li class="number">Or seven fair branches springing from one root.</li>
  <li class="number">Some of those seven are dried by nature’s course,</li>
  <li class="number">Some of those branches by the Destinies cut;</li>
  <li class="number">But Thomas, my dear lord, my life, my Gloucester,</li>
  <li class="number">One vial full of Edward’s sacred blood,</li>
  <li class="number">One flourishing branch of his most royal root,</li>
  <li class="number">Is crack’d, and all the precious liquor spilt,</li>
  <li class="number">Is hack’d down, and his summer leaves all faded,</li>
  <li class="number">By envy’s hand and murder’s bloody axe.</li>
  <li class="number">Ah, Gaunt, his blood was thine! That bed, that womb,</li>
  <li class="number">That mettle, that self mould, that fashioned thee</li>
  <li class="number">Made him a man; and though thou livest and breathest,</li>
  <li class="number">Yet art thou slain in him. Thou dost consent</li>
  <li class="number">In some large measure to thy father’s death,</li>
  <li class="number">In that thou seest thy wretched brother die,</li>
  <li class="number">Who was the model of thy father’s life.</li>
  <li class="number">Call it not patience, Gaunt, it is despair.</li>
  <li class="number">In suff’ring thus thy brother to be slaught’red,</li>
  <li class="number">Thou showest the naked pathway to thy life,</li>
  <li class="number">Teaching stern murder how to butcher thee.</li>
  <li class="number">That which in mean men we entitle patience</li>
  <li class="number">Is pale cold cowardice in noble breasts.</li>
  <li class="number">What shall I say? To safeguard thine own life</li>
  <li class="number">The best way is to venge my Gloucester’s death.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GAUNT.">
  <li class="number">God’s is the quarrel, for God’s substitute,</li>
  <li class="number">His deputy anointed in His sight,</li>
  <li class="number">Hath caus’d his death, the which if wrongfully,</li>
  <li class="number">Let heaven revenge, for I may never lift</li>
  <li class="number">An angry arm against His minister.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUCH.">
  <li class="number">Where then, alas, may I complain myself?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GAUNT.">
  <li class="number">To God, the widow’s champion and defense.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUCH.">
  <li class="number">Why then I will. Farewell, old Gaunt!</li>
  <li class="number">Thou goest to Coventry, there to behold</li>
  <li class="number">Our cousin Herford and fell Mowbray fight.</li>
  <li class="number">O, sit my husband’s wrongs on Herford’s spear,</li>
  <li class="number">That it may enter butcher Mowbray’s breast!</li>
  <li class="number">Or if misfortune miss the first career,</li>
  <li class="number">Be Mowbray’s sins so heavy in his bosom</li>
  <li class="number">That they may break his foaming courser’s back,</li>
  <li class="number">And throw the rider headlong in the lists,</li>
  <li class="number">A caitiff recreant to my cousin Herford!</li>
  <li class="number">Farewell, old Gaunt! Thy sometimes brother’s wife</li>
  <li class="number">With her companion, grief, must end her life.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GAUNT.">
  <li class="number">Sister, farewell, I must to Coventry.</li>
  <li class="number">As much good stay with thee as go with me!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUCH.">
  <li class="number">Yet one word more! Grief boundeth where it falls,</li>
  <li class="number">Not with the empty hollowness, but weight.</li>
  <li class="number">I take my leave before I have begun,</li>
  <li class="number">For sorrow ends not when it seemeth done.</li>
  <li class="number">Commend me to thy brother, Edmund York.</li>
  <li class="number">Lo this is all—nay, yet depart not so;</li>
  <li class="number">Though this be all, do not so quickly go;</li>
  <li class="number">I shall remember more. Bid him—ah, what?—</li>
  <li class="number">With all good speed at Plashy visit me.</li>
  <li class="number">Alack, and what shall good old York there see</li>
  <li class="number">But empty lodgings and unfurnish’d walls,</li>
  <li class="number">Unpeopled offices, untrodden stones?</li>
  <li class="number">And what hear there for welcome but my groans?</li>
  <li class="number">Therefore commend me; let him not come there</li>
  <li class="number">To seek out sorrow that dwells every where.</li>
  <li class="number">Desolate, desolate, will I hence and die:</li>
  <li class="number">The last leave of thee takes my weeping eye.</li>

  <li class="number">O but they say the tongues of dying men</li>
  <li class="number">Enforce attention like deep harmony.</li>
  <li class="number">Where words are scarce, they are seldom spent in vain,</li>
  <li class="number">For they breathe truth that breathe their words in pain.</li>
  <li class="number">He that no more must say is listened more</li>
  <li class="number">Than they whom youth and ease have taught to glose.</li>
  <li class="number">More are men’s ends mark’d than their lives before.</li>

  <li class="number">Though Richard my live’s counsel would not hear,</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="YORK.">
  <li class="number">No, it is stopp’d with other flattering sounds,</li>
  <li class="number">As praises, of whose taste the wise are fond,</li>
  <li class="number">Lascivious metres, to whose venom sound</li>
  <li class="number">The open ear of youth doth always listen;</li>
  <li class="number">Report of fashions in proud Italy,</li>
  <li class="number">Whose manners still our tardy, apish nation</li>
  <li class="number">Limps after in base imitation.</li>
  <li class="number">Where doth the world thrust forth a vanity—</li>
  <li class="number">So it be new, there’s no respect how vile—</li>
  <li class="number">That is not quickly buzz’d into his ears?</li>

<h4>Windsor Castle.</h4>

<div class="stage-direction">
	Enter the Queen, Bushy, Bagot.
	
		QUEEN.
		BUSHY.
		BAGOT.
	
</div>

<ol data-speaker="BUSHY.">
  <li class="number">Madam, your Majesty is too much sad.</li>
  <li class="number">You promis’d, when you parted with the King,</li>
  <li class="number">To lay aside life-harming heaviness</li>
  <li class="number">And entertain a cheerful disposition.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUEEN.">
  <li class="number">To please the King I did, to please myself</li>
  <li class="number">I cannot do it; yet I know no cause</li>
  <li class="number">Why I should welcome such a guest as grief,</li>
  <li class="number">Save bidding farewell to so sweet a guest</li>
  <li class="number">As my sweet Richard. Yet again methinks</li>
  <li class="number">Some unborn sorrow, ripe in fortune’s womb,</li>
  <li class="number">Is coming towards me, and my inward soul</li>
  <li class="number">With nothing trembles; at some thing it grieves,</li>
  <li class="number">More than with parting from my lord the King.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BUSHY.">
  <li class="number">Each substance of a grief hath twenty shadows,</li>
  <li class="number">Which shows like grief itself, but is not so;</li>
  <li class="number">For sorrow’s eyes, glazed with blinding tears,</li>
  <li class="number">Divides one thing entire to many objects,</li>
  <li class="number">Like perspectives, which rightly gaz’d upon</li>
  <li class="number">Show nothing but confusion; ey’d awry</li>
  <li class="number">Distinguish form; so your sweet Majesty,</li>
  <li class="number">Looking awry upon your lord’s departure,</li>
  <li class="number">Find shapes of grief, more than himself, to wail,</li>
  <li class="number">Which, look’d on as it is, is nought but shadows</li>
  <li class="number">Of what it is not; then, thrice-gracious Queen,</li>
  <li class="number">More than your lord’s departure weep not—more is not seen,</li>
  <li class="number">Or if it be, ’tis with false sorrow’s eye,</li>
  <li class="number">Which for things true weeps things imaginary.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUEEN.">
  <li class="number">It may be so; but yet my inward soul</li>
  <li class="number">Persuades me it is otherwise. Howe’er it be,</li>
  <li class="number">I cannot but be sad; so heavy sad,</li>
  <li class="number">As, though on thinking on no thought I think,</li>
  <li class="number">Makes me with heavy nothing faint and shrink.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BUSHY.">
  <li class="number">’Tis nothing but conceit, my gracious lady.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUEEN.">
  <li class="number">’Tis nothing less: conceit is still deriv’d</li>
  <li class="number">From some forefather grief; mine is not so,</li>
  <li class="number">For nothing hath begot my something grief,</li>
  <li class="number">Or something hath the nothing that I grieve—</li>
  <li class="number">’Tis in reversion that I do possess—</li>
  <li class="number">But what it is that is not yet known what,</li>
  <li class="number">I cannot name; ’tis nameless woe, I wot.</li>

  <li class="number">Why hopest thou so? ’Tis better hope he is,</li>

  <li class="number">Then wherefore dost thou hope he is not shipp’d?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GREEN.">
  <li class="number">That he, our hope, might have retir’d his power,</li>

  <li class="number">The Lord Northumberland, his son young Harry Percy,</li>
  <li class="number">The Lords of Ross, Beaumond, and Willoughby,</li>
  <li class="number">With all their powerful friends, are fled to him.</li>

<ol data-speaker="BUSHY.">
  <li class="number">Why have you not proclaim’d Northumberland</li>

  <li class="number">Hath broken his staff, resign’d his stewardship,</li>
  <li class="number">And all the household servants fled with him</li>
  <li class="number">To Bullingbrook.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUEEN.">
  <li class="number">So, Green, thou art the midwife to my woe,</li>

  <li class="number">Have woe to woe, sorrow to sorrow join’d.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BUSHY.">
  <li class="number">Despair not, madam.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="QUEEN.">
  <li class="number">Who shall hinder me?</li>
  <li class="number">I will despair, and be at enmity</li>
  <li class="number">With cozening hope. He is a flatterer,</li>
  <li class="number">A parasite, a keeper-back of death,</li>

  <li class="number">These high wild hills and rough uneven ways</li>
  <li class="number">Draws out our miles and makes them wearisome,</li>
  <li class="number">And yet your fair discourse hath been as sugar,</li>
  <li class="number">Making the hard way sweet and delectable.</li>
  <li class="number">But I bethink me what a weary way</li>
  <li class="number">From Ravenspurgh to Cotshall will be found</li>
  <li class="number">In Ross and Willoughby, wanting your company,</li>
  <li class="number">Which, I protest, hath very much beguil’d</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NORTH.">

<ol data-speaker="PERCY.">

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="YORK.">

  <li class="number">Whilst all tongues cried, “God save thee, Bullingbrook!”</li>
  <li class="number">You would have thought the very windows spake,</li>
  <li class="number">So many greedy looks of young and old</li>
  <li class="number">Through casements darted their desiring eyes</li>
  <li class="number">Upon his visage, and that all the walls</li>
  <li class="number">With painted imagery had said at once,</li>
  <li class="number">“Jesu preserve thee! Welcome, Bullingbrook!”</li>
  <li class="number">Whilst he, from the one side to the other turning,</li>
  <li class="number">Bare-headed, lower than his proud steed’s neck,</li>

  <li class="number">Even so, or with much more contempt, men’s eyes</li>
  <li class="number">Did scowl on gentle Richard. No man cried “God save him!”</li>
  <li class="number">No joyful tongue gave him his welcome home,</li>
  <li class="number">But dust was thrown upon his sacred head,</li>

  <li class="number">His face still combating with tears and smiles,</li>
  <li class="number">The badges of his grief and patience,</li>
  <li class="number">That had not God, for some strong purpose, steel’d</li>

</div>

<ol data-speaker="K. RICH.">
  <li class="number">I have been studying how I may compare</li>
  <li class="number">This prison where I live unto the world;</li>
  <li class="number">And for because the world is populous,</li>
  <li class="number">And here is not a creature but myself,</li>
  <li class="number">I cannot do it; yet I’ll hammer it out.</li>
  <li class="number">My brain I’ll prove the female to my soul,</li>
  <li class="number">My soul the father, and these two beget</li>
  <li class="number">A generation of still-breeding thoughts;</li>
  <li class="number">And these some thoughts people this little world,</li>
  <li class="number">In humors like the people of this world:</li>
  <li class="number">For no thought is contented. The better sort,</li>
  <li class="number">As thoughts of things divine, are intermix’d</li>
  <li class="number">With scruples and do set the word itself</li>
  <li class="number">Against the word,</li>
  <li class="number">As thus: “Come, little ones,” and then again,</li>
  <li class="number">“It is as hard to come as for a camel</li>
  <li class="number">To thread the postern of a small needle’s eye.”</li>
  <li class="number">Thoughts tending to ambition, they do plot</li>
  <li class="number">Unlikely wonders: how these vain weak nails</li>
  <li class="number">May tear a passage thorough the flinty ribs</li>
  <li class="number">Of this hard world, my ragged prison walls;</li>
  <li class="number">And for they cannot, die in their own pride.</li>
  <li class="number">Thoughts tending to content flatter themselves</li>
  <li class="number">That they are not the first of fortune’s slaves,</li>
  <li class="number">Nor shall not be the last—like seely beggars</li>
  <li class="number">Who sitting in the stocks refuge their shame,</li>
  <li class="number">That many have and others must sit there;</li>
  <li class="number">And in this thought they find a kind of ease,</li>
  <li class="number">Bearing their own misfortunes on the back</li>
  <li class="number">Of such as have before endur’d the like.</li>
  <li class="number">Thus play I in one person many people,</li>
  <li class="number">And none contented. Sometimes am I king;</li>
  <li class="number">Then treasons make me wish myself a beggar,</li>
  <li class="number">And so I am. Then crushing penury</li>
  <li class="number">Persuades me I was better when a king;</li>
  <li class="number">Then am I king’d again, and by and by</li>
  <li class="number">Think that I am unking’d by Bullingbrook,</li>
  <li class="number">And straight am nothing. But what e’er I be,</li>
  <li class="number">Nor I, nor any man that but man is,</li>

  <li class="number">And here have I the daintiness of ear</li>
  <li class="number">To check time broke in a disordered string;</li>
  <li class="number">But for the concord of my state and time</li>
  <li class="number">Had not an ear to hear my true time broke.</li>
  <li class="number">I wasted time, and now doth time waste me;</li>
  <li class="number">For now hath time made me his numb’ring clock:</li>
  <li class="number">My thoughts are minutes, and with sighs they jar</li>
  <li class="number">Their watches on unto mine eyes, the outward watch,</li>
  <li class="number">Whereto my finger, like a dial’s point,</li>
  <li class="number">Is pointing still, in cleansing them from tears.</li>
  <li class="number">Now, sir, the sound that tells what hour it is</li>
  <li class="number">Are clamorous groans, which strike upon my heart,</li>
  <li class="number">Which is the bell. So sighs, and tears, and groans</li>
  <li class="number">Show minutes, times, and hours; but my time</li>
  <li class="number">Runs posting on in Bullingbrook’s proud joy,</li>
  <li class="number">While I stand fooling here, his Jack of the clock.</li>
  <li class="number">This music mads me, let it sound no more,</li>
  <li class="number">For though it have holp mad men to their wits,</li>
  <li class="number">In me it seems it will make wise men mad.</li>
  <li class="number">Yet blessing on his heart that gives it me!</li>
