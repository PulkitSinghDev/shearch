<h3>Scene 1</h3>

<h4>Warkworth. Before Northumberland’s castle.</h4>

<div class="stage-direction">
	Enter the Lord Bardolph at one door.
	
		L. BARD.
	
</div>

<ol data-speaker="L. BARD.">
  <li class="number">Who keeps the gate here ho?</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">
	Enter Porter.
	
		PORT.
	
</li>
  <li class="number">Where is the Earl?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PORT.">
  <li class="number">What shall I say you are?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="L. BARD.">
  <li class="number">Tell thou the Earl</li>
  <li class="number">That the Lord Bardolph doth attend him here.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PORT.">
  <li class="number">His lordship is walk’d forth into the orchard.</li>
  <li class="number">Please it your honor knock but at the gate,</li>
  <li class="number">And he himself will answer.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">
	Enter Henry Percy, the Earl Northumberland, in a night-cap and supporting himself with a staff.
	
		NORTH.
	
</div>

<ol data-speaker="L. BARD.">
  <li class="number">Here comes the Earl.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">
	Exit Porter.

<ol data-speaker="NORTH.">
  <li class="number">What news, Lord Bardolph? Every minute now</li>
  <li class="number">Should be the father of some stratagem.</li>
  <li class="number">The times are wild, contention, like a horse</li>
  <li class="number">Full of high feeding, madly hath broke loose,</li>
  <li class="number">And bears down all before him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="L. BARD.">
  <li class="number">Noble Earl,</li>
  <li class="number">I bring you certain news from Shrewsbury.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NORTH.">
  <li class="number">Good, and God will!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="L. BARD.">
  <li class="number">As good as heart can wish:</li>
  <li class="number">The King is almost wounded to the death,</li>
  <li class="number">And in the fortune of my lord your son,</li>
  <li class="number">Prince Harry slain outright, and both the Blunts</li>
  <li class="number">Kill’d by the hand of Douglas, young Prince John</li>
  <li class="number">And Westmorland and Stafford fled the field,</li>
  <li class="number">And Harry Monmouth’s brawn, the hulk Sir John,</li>
  <li class="number">Is prisoner to your son. O, such a day!</li>
  <li class="number">So fought, so followed, and so fairly won,</li>
  <li class="number">Came not till now to dignify the times,</li>
  <li class="number">Since Caesar’s fortunes.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NORTH.">
  <li class="number">How is this deriv’d?</li>
  <li class="number">Saw you the field? Came you from Shrewsbury?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="L. BARD.">
  <li class="number">I spake with one, my lord, that came from thence,</li>
  <li class="number">A gentleman well bred and of good name,</li>
  <li class="number">That freely rend’red me these news for true.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NORTH.">
  <li class="number">Here comes my servant Travers, who I sent</li>
  <li class="number">On Tuesday last to listen after news.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">
	Enter Travers.
	
		TRA.
	
</div>

<ol data-speaker="L. BARD.">
  <li class="number">My lord, I overrode him on the way,</li>
  <li class="number">And he is furnish’d with no certainties</li>
  <li class="number">More than he haply may retail from me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NORTH.">
  <li class="number">Now, Travers, what good tidings comes with you?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TRA.">
  <li class="number">My lord, Sir John Umfrevile turn’d me back</li>
  <li class="number">With joyful tidings, and being better hors’d,</li>
  <li class="number">Outrode me. After him came spurring hard</li>
  <li class="number">A gentleman, almost forespent with speed,</li>
  <li class="number">That stopp’d by me to breathe his bloodied horse.</li>
  <li class="number">He ask’d the way to Chester, and of him</li>
  <li class="number">I did demand what news from Shrewsbury.</li>
  <li class="number">He told me that rebellion had bad luck,</li>
  <li class="number">And that young Harry Percy’s spur was cold.</li>
  <li class="number">With that he gave his able horse the head,</li>
  <li class="number">And bending forward struck his armed heels</li>
  <li class="number">Against the panting sides of his poor jade</li>
  <li class="number">Up to the rowel-head, and starting so</li>
  <li class="number">He seem’d in running to devour the way,</li>
  <li class="number">Staying no longer question.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NORTH.">
  <li class="number">Ha? Again.</li>
  <li class="number">Said he young Harry Percy’s spur was cold?</li>
  <li class="number">Of Hotspur, Coldspur? That rebellion</li>
  <li class="number">Had met ill luck?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="L. BARD.">
  <li class="number">My lord, I’ll tell you what:</li>
  <li class="number">If my young lord your son have not the day,</li>
  <li class="number">Upon mine honor, for a silken point</li>
  <li class="number">I’ll give my barony. Never talk of it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NORTH.">
  <li class="number">Why should that gentleman that rode by Travers</li>
  <li class="number">Give then such instances of loss?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="L. BARD.">
  <li class="number">Who, he?</li>
  <li class="number">He was some hilding fellow that had stol’n</li>
  <li class="number">The horse he rode on, and, upon my life,</li>
  <li class="number">Spoke at a venter. Look, here comes more news.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">
	Enter Morton.
	
		MOR.
	
</div>

<ol data-speaker="NORTH.">
  <li class="number">Yea, this man’s brow, like to a title-leaf,</li>
  <li class="number">Foretells the nature of a tragic volume.</li>
  <li class="number">So looks the strond whereon the imperious flood</li>
  <li class="number">Hath left a witness’d usurpation.</li>
  <li class="number">Say, Morton, didst thou come from Shrewsbury?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOR.">
  <li class="number">I ran from Shrewsbury, my noble lord,</li>
  <li class="number">Where hateful death put on his ugliest mask</li>
  <li class="number">To fright our party.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NORTH.">
  <li class="number">How doth my son and brother?</li>
  <li class="number">Thou tremblest, and the whiteness in thy cheek</li>
  <li class="number">Is apter than thy tongue to tell thy arrand.</li>
  <li class="number">Even such a man, so faint, so spiritless,</li>
  <li class="number">So dull, so dead in look, so woe-begone,</li>
  <li class="number">Drew Priam’s curtain in the dead of night,</li>
  <li class="number">And would have told him half his Troy was burnt;</li>
  <li class="number">But Priam found the fire ere he his tongue,</li>
  <li class="number">And I my Percy’s death ere thou report’st it.</li>
  <li class="number">This thou wouldst say, “Your son did thus and thus;</li>
  <li class="number">Your brother thus; so fought the noble Douglas”—</li>
  <li class="number">Stopping my greedy ear with their bold deeds,</li>
  <li class="number">But in the end, to stop my ear indeed,</li>
  <li class="number">Thou hast a sigh to blow away this praise,</li>
  <li class="number">Ending with “Brother, son, and all are dead.”</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOR.">
  <li class="number">Douglas is living, and your brother yet,</li>
  <li class="number">But for my lord your son—</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NORTH.">
  <li class="number">Why, he is dead.</li>
  <li class="number">See what a ready tongue suspicion hath!</li>
  <li class="number">He that but fears the thing he would not know</li>
  <li class="number">Hath by instinct knowledge from others’ eyes</li>
  <li class="number">That what he fear’d is chanced. Yet speak, Morton,</li>
  <li class="number">Tell thou an earl his divination lies,</li>
  <li class="number">And I will take it as a sweet disgrace</li>
  <li class="number">And make thee rich for doing me such wrong.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOR.">
  <li class="number">You are too great to be by me gainsaid,</li>
  <li class="number">Your spirit is too true, your fears too certain.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NORTH.">
  <li class="number">Yet for all this, say not that Percy’s dead.</li>
  <li class="number">I see a strange confession in thine eye.</li>
  <li class="number">Thou shak’st thy head, and hold’st it fear or sin</li>
  <li class="number">To speak a truth. If he be slain, say so;</li>
  <li class="number">The tongue offends not that reports his death,</li>
  <li class="number">And he doth sin that doth belie the dead,</li>
  <li class="number">Not he which says the dead is not alive.</li>
  <li class="number">Yet the first bringer of unwelcome news</li>
  <li class="number">Hath but a losing office, and his tongue</li>
  <li class="number">Sounds ever after as a sullen bell,</li>
  <li class="number">Rememb’red tolling a departing friend.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="L. BARD.">
  <li class="number">I cannot think, my lord, your son is dead.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOR.">
  <li class="number">I am sorry I should force you to believe</li>
  <li class="number">That which I would to God I had not seen,</li>
  <li class="number">But these mine eyes saw him in bloody state,</li>
  <li class="number">Rend’ring faint quittance, wearied and outbreath’d,</li>
  <li class="number">To Harry Monmouth, whose swift wrath beat down</li>
  <li class="number">The never-daunted Percy to the earth,</li>
  <li class="number">From whence with life he never more sprung up.</li>
  <li class="number">In few, his death, whose spirit lent a fire</li>
  <li class="number">Even to the dullest peasant in his camp,</li>
  <li class="number">Being bruited once, took fire and heat away</li>
  <li class="number">From the best-temper’d courage in his troops,</li>
  <li class="number">For from his metal was his party steeled,</li>
  <li class="number">Which once in him abated, all the rest</li>
  <li class="number">Turn’d on themselves, like dull and heavy lead.</li>
  <li class="number">And as the thing that’s heavy in itself</li>
  <li class="number">Upon enforcement flies with greatest speed,</li>
  <li class="number">So did our men, heavy in Hotspur’s loss,</li>
  <li class="number">Lend to this weight such lightness with their fear</li>
  <li class="number">That arrows fled not swifter toward their aim</li>
  <li class="number">Than did our soldiers, aiming at their safety,</li>
  <li class="number">Fly from the field. Then was that noble Worcester</li>
  <li class="number">So soon ta’en prisoner, and that furious Scot,</li>
  <li class="number">The bloody Douglas, whose well-laboring sword</li>
  <li class="number">Had three times slain th’ appearance of the King,</li>
  <li class="number">Gan vail his stomach and did grace the shame</li>
  <li class="number">Of those that turn’d their backs, and in his flight,</li>
  <li class="number">Stumbling in fear, was took. The sum of all</li>
  <li class="number">Is that the King hath won, and hath sent out</li>
  <li class="number">A speedy power to encounter you, my lord,</li>
  <li class="number">Under the conduct of young Lancaster</li>
  <li class="number">And Westmorland. This is the news at full.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NORTH.">
  <li class="number">For this I shall have time enough to mourn;</li>
  <li class="number">In poison there is physic, and these news,</li>
  <li class="number">Having been well, that would have made me sick,</li>
  <li class="number">Being sick, have (in some measure) made me well.</li>
  <li class="number">And as the wretch whose fever-weak’ned joints,</li>
  <li class="number">Like strengthless hinges, buckle under life,</li>
  <li class="number">Impatient of his fit, breaks like a fire</li>
  <li class="number">Out of his keeper’s arms, even so my limbs,</li>
  <li class="number">Weak’ned with grief, being now enrag’d with grief,</li>
  <li class="number">Are thrice themselves. Hence therefore, thou nice crutch!</li>
  <li class="number">A scaly gauntlet now with joints of steel</li>
  <li class="number">Must glove this hand; and hence, thou sickly coif!</li>
  <li class="number">That art a guard too wanton for the head</li>
  <li class="number">Which princes, flesh’d with conquest, aim to hit.</li>
  <li class="number">Now bind my brows with iron, and approach</li>
  <li class="number">The ragged’st hour that time and spite dare bring</li>
  <li class="number">To frown upon th’ enrag’d Northumberland!</li>
  <li class="number">Let heaven kiss earth! Now let not Nature’s hand</li>
  <li class="number">Keep the wild flood confin’d! Let order die!</li>
  <li class="number">And let this world no longer be a stage</li>
  <li class="number">To feed contention in a ling’ring act;</li>
  <li class="number">But let one spirit of the first-born Cain</li>
  <li class="number">Reign in all bosoms, that each heart being set</li>
  <li class="number">On bloody courses, the rude scene may end,</li>
  <li class="number">And darkness be the burier of the dead!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="L. BARD.">
  <li class="number">This strained passion doth you wrong, my lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOR.">
  <li class="number">Sweet Earl, divorce not wisdom from your honor,</li>
  <li class="number">The lives of all your loving complices</li>
  <li class="number">Lean on your health, the which, if you give o’er</li>
  <li class="number">To stormy passion, must perforce decay.</li>
  <li class="number">You cast th’ event of war, my noble lord,</li>
  <li class="number">And summ’d the accompt of chance before you said,</li>
  <li class="number">“Let us make head.” It was your presurmise</li>
  <li class="number">That in the dole of blows your son might drop.</li>
  <li class="number">You knew he walk’d o’er perils, on an edge,</li>
  <li class="number">More likely to fall in than to get o’er;</li>
  <li class="number">You were advis’d his flesh was capable</li>
  <li class="number">Of wounds and scars; and that his forward spirit</li>
  <li class="number">Would lift him where most trade of danger rang’d;</li>
  <li class="number">Yet did you say, “Go forth!” and none of this</li>
  <li class="number">(Though strongly apprehended) could restrain</li>
  <li class="number">The stiff-borne action. What hath then befall’n?</li>
  <li class="number">Or what doth this bold enterprise bring forth</li>
  <li class="number">More than that being which was like to be?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="L. BARD.">
  <li class="number">We all that are engaged to this loss</li>
  <li class="number">Knew that we ventured on such dangerous seas</li>
  <li class="number">That if we wrought out life ’twas ten to one,</li>
  <li class="number">And yet we ventur’d for the gain propos’d,</li>
  <li class="number">Chok’d the respect of likely peril fear’d,</li>
  <li class="number">And since we are o’erset, venture again.</li>
  <li class="number">Come, we will all put forth, body and goods.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOR.">
  <li class="number">’Tis more than time, and, my most noble lord,</li>
  <li class="number">I hear for certain and dare speak the truth,</li>
  <li class="number">The gentle Archbishop of York is up</li>
  <li class="number">With well-appointed pow’rs. He is a man</li>
  <li class="number">Who with a double surety binds his followers.</li>
  <li class="number">My lord your son had only but the corpse’,</li>
  <li class="number">But shadows and the shows of men, to fight;</li>
  <li class="number">For that same word, rebellion, did divide</li>
  <li class="number">The action of their bodies from their souls,</li>
  <li class="number">And they did fight with queasiness, constrain’d</li>
  <li class="number">As men drink potions, that their weapons only</li>
  <li class="number">Seem’d on our side; but for their spirits and souls,</li>
  <li class="number">This word, rebellion, it had froze them up,</li>
  <li class="number">As fish are in a pond. But now the Bishop</li>
  <li class="number">Turns insurrection to religion.</li>
  <li class="number">Suppos’d sincere and holy in his thoughts,</li>
  <li class="number">He’s follow’d both with body and with mind;</li>
  <li class="number">And doth enlarge his rising with the blood</li>
  <li class="number">Of fair King Richard, scrap’d from Pomfret stones;</li>
  <li class="number">Derives from heaven his quarrel and his cause;</li>
  <li class="number">Tells them he doth bestride a bleeding land,</li>
  <li class="number">Gasping for life under great Bullingbrook,</li>
  <li class="number">And more and less do flock to follow him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NORTH.">
  <li class="number">I knew of this before, but to speak truth,</li>
  <li class="number">This present grief had wip’d it from my mind.</li>
  <li class="number">Go in with me, and counsel every man</li>
  <li class="number">The aptest way for safety and revenge.</li>
  <li class="number">Get posts and letters, and make friends with speed—</li>
  <li class="number">Never so few, and never yet more need.</li>

<h3>Scene 2</h3>

<h4>London. A street.</h4>

<div class="stage-direction">
	Enter Sir John Falstaff alone, with his Page, following behind, bearing his sword and buckler.
	
		FAL.
		PAGE.
	
</div>

<ol data-speaker="FAL.">
  <li class="number">Sirrah, you giant, what says the doctor to my water?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAGE.">
  <li class="number">He said, sir, the water itself was a good healthy water, but for the party that ow’d it, he might have more diseases than he knew for.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FAL.">
  <li class="number">Men of all sorts take a pride to gird at me. The brain of this foolish-compounded clay, man, is not able to invent any thing that intends to laughter more than I invent or is invented on me: I am not only witty in myself, but the cause that wit is in other men. I do here walk before thee like a sow that hath overwhelm’d all her litter but one. If the Prince put thee into my service for any other reason than to set me off, why then I have no judgment. Thou whoreson mandrake, thou art fitter to be worn in my cap than to wait at my heels. I was never mann’d with an agot till now, but I will inset you neither in gold nor silver, but in vile apparel, and send you back again to your master for a jewel—the juvenal, the Prince your master, whose chin is not yet fledge. I will sooner have a beard grow in the palm of my hand than he shall get one of his cheek, and yet he will not stick to say his face is a face royal. God may finish it when he will, ’tis not a hair amiss yet. He may keep it still at a face royal, for a barber shall never earn sixpence out of it; and yet he’ll be crowing as if he had writ man ever since his father was a bachelor. He may keep his own grace, but he’s almost out of mine, I can assure him. What said Master Dommelton about the satin for my short cloak and my slops?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAGE.">
  <li class="number">He said, sir, you should procure him better assurance than Bardolph. He would not take his bond and yours, he lik’d not the security.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FAL.">
  <li class="number">Let him be damn’d like the glutton! Pray God his tongue be hotter! A whoreson Achitophel! A rascally yea-forsooth knave, to bear a gentleman in hand, and then stand upon security! The whoreson smoothy-pates do now wear nothing but high shoes, and bunches of keys at their girdles, and if a man is through with them in honest taking up, then they must stand upon security. I had as live they would put ratsbane in my mouth as offer to stop it with security. I look’d ’a should have sent me two and twenty yards of satin (as I am a true knight), and he sends me security! Well, he may sleep in security, for he hath the horn of abundance, and the lightness of his wife shines through it; and yet cannot he see, though he have his own lantern to light him. Where’s Bardolph?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAGE.">
  <li class="number">He’s gone into Smithfield to buy your worship a horse.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FAL.">
  <li class="number">I bought him in Paul’s, and he’ll buy me a horse in Smithfield; and I could get me but a wife in the stews, I were mann’d, hors’d, and wiv’d.</li>

<div class="stage-direction">
	Enter Lord Chief Justice and Servant.

</div>

<ol data-speaker="PAGE.">
  <li class="number">Sir, here comes the nobleman that committed the Prince for striking him about Bardolph.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FAL.">
  <li class="number">Wait close, I will not see him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CH. JUST.">
  <li class="number">What’s he that goes there?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SERV.">
  <li class="number">Falstaff, and’t please your lordship.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CH. JUST.">
  <li class="number">He that was in question for the robb’ry?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SERV.">
  <li class="number">He, my lord, but he hath since done good service at Shrewsbury, and (as I hear) is now going with some charge to the Lord John of Lancaster.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CH. JUST.">
  <li class="number">What, to York? Call him back again.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SERV.">
  <li class="number">Sir John Falstaff!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FAL.">
  <li class="number">Boy, tell him I am deaf.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAGE.">
  <li class="number">You must speak louder, my master is deaf.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CH. JUST.">
  <li class="number">I am sure he is, to the hearing of any thing good. Go pluck him by the elbow, I must speak with him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SERV.">
  <li class="number">Sir John!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FAL.">
  <li class="number">What? A young knave, and begging? Is there not wars? Is there not employment? Doth not the King lack subjects? Do not the rebels need soldiers? Though it be a shame to be on any side but one, it is worse shame to beg than to be on the worst side, were it worse than the name of rebellion can tell how to make it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SERV.">
  <li class="number">You mistake me, sir.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FAL.">
  <li class="number">Why, sir, did I say you were an honest man? Setting my knighthood and my soldiership aside, I had lied in my throat if I had said so.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SERV.">
  <li class="number">I pray you, sir, then set your knighthood and your soldiership aside, and give me leave to tell you you lie in your throat if you say I am any other than an honest man.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FAL.">
  <li class="number">I give thee leave to tell me so? I lay aside that which grows to me? If thou get’st any leave of me, hang me; if thou tak’st leave, thou wert better be hang’d. You hunt counter, hence, avaunt!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SERV.">
  <li class="number">Sir, my lord would speak with you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CH. JUST.">
  <li class="number">Sir John Falstaff, a word with you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FAL.">
  <li class="number">My good lord! God give your lordship good time of day. I am glad to see your lordship abroad. I heard say your lordship was sick, I hope your lordship goes abroad by advice. Your lordship, though not clean past your youth, have yet some smack of an ague in you, some relish of the saltness of time in you, and I most humbly beseech your lordship to have a reverend care of your health.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CH. JUST.">
  <li class="number">Sir John, I sent for you before your expedition to Shrewsbury.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FAL.">
  <li class="number">And’t please your lordship, I hear his Majesty is return’d with some discomfort from Wales.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CH. JUST.">
  <li class="number">I talk not of his Majesty. You would not come when I sent for you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FAL.">
  <li class="number">And I hear, moreover, his Highness is fall’n into this same whoreson apoplexy.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CH. JUST.">
  <li class="number">Well, God mend him! I pray you let me speak with you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FAL.">
  <li class="number">This apoplexy, as I take it, is a kind of lethargy, and’t please your lordship, a kind of sleeping in the blood, a whoreson tingling.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CH. JUST.">
  <li class="number">What tell you me of it? Be it as it is.</li>

Virtue is of so little regard in these costermongers’ times that true valor is turn’d berrord; pregnancy is made a tapster, and his quick wit wasted in giving reckonings; all the other gifts appertinent to man, as the malice of this age shapes them, are not worth a gooseberry. You that are old consider not the capacities of us that are young, you do measure the heat of our livers with the bitterness of your galls; and we that are in the vaward of our youth, I must confess, are wags too.</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FAL.">
  <li class="number">My lord, I was born about three of the clock in the afternoon, with a white head and something a round belly. For my voice, I have lost it with hallowing and singing of anthems. To approve my youth further, I will not. The truth is, I am only old in judgment and understanding; and he that will caper with me for a thousand marks, let him lend me the money, and have at him! For the box of the year that the Prince gave you, he gave it like a rude prince, and you took it like a sensible lord. I have check’d him for it, and the young lion repents,</li>

<h4>York. A room in the Archbishop’s palace.</h4>

<div class="stage-direction">
	Enter the Archbishop of York, Thomas Mowbray Earl Marshal, the Lord Hastings, and Lord Bardolph.
	
		ARCH.
		MOWB.
		HAST.
		L. BARD.
	
</div>

<ol data-speaker="ARCH.">
  <li class="number">Thus have you heard our cause and known our means,</li>
  <li class="number">And, my most noble friends, I pray you all</li>
  <li class="number">Speak plainly your opinions of our hopes.</li>
  <li class="number">And first, Lord Marshal, what say you to it?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOWB.">
  <li class="number">I well allow the occasion of our arms,</li>
  <li class="number">But gladly would be better satisfied</li>
  <li class="number">How in our means we should advance ourselves</li>
  <li class="number">To look with forehead bold and big enough</li>
  <li class="number">Upon the power and puissance of the King.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAST.">
  <li class="number">Our present musters grow upon the file</li>
  <li class="number">To five and twenty thousand men of choice,</li>
  <li class="number">And our supplies live largely in the hope</li>
  <li class="number">Of great Northumberland, whose bosom burns</li>
  <li class="number">With an incensed fire of injuries.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="L. BARD.">
  <li class="number">The question then, Lord Hastings, standeth thus:</li>
  <li class="number">Whether our present five and twenty thousand</li>
  <li class="number">May hold up head without Northumberland?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAST.">
  <li class="number">With him, we may.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="L. BARD.">
  <li class="number">Yea, marry, there’s the point!</li>
  <li class="number">But if without him we be thought too feeble,</li>
  <li class="number">My judgment is we should not step too far</li>
  <li class="number">Till we had his assistance by the hand.</li>
  <li class="number">For in a theme so bloody-fac’d as this,</li>
  <li class="number">Conjecture, expectation, and surmise</li>
  <li class="number">Of aids incertain should not be admitted.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ARCH.">
  <li class="number">’Tis very true, Lord Bardolph, for indeed</li>
  <li class="number">It was young Hotspur’s cause at Shrewsbury.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="L. BARD.">
  <li class="number">It was, my lord, who lin’d himself with hope,</li>
  <li class="number">Eating the air, and promise of supply,</li>
  <li class="number">Flatt’ring himself in project of a power</li>
  <li class="number">Much smaller than the smallest of his thoughts,</li>
  <li class="number">And so with great imagination,</li>
  <li class="number">Proper to madmen, led his powers to death,</li>
  <li class="number">And winking, leapt into destruction.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAST.">
  <li class="number">But by your leave, it never yet did hurt</li>
  <li class="number">To lay down likelihoods and forms of hope.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="L. BARD.">
  <li class="number">Yes, if this present quality of war—</li>
  <li class="number">Indeed the instant action, a cause on foot—</li>
  <li class="number">Lives so in hope, as in an early spring</li>
  <li class="number">We see th’ appearing buds, which to prove fruit</li>
  <li class="number">Hope gives not so much warrant, as despair</li>
  <li class="number">That frosts will bite them. When we mean to build,</li>
  <li class="number">We first survey the plot, then draw the model,</li>
  <li class="number">And when we see the figure of the house,</li>
  <li class="number">Then must we rate the cost of the erection,</li>
  <li class="number">Which if we find outweighs ability,</li>
  <li class="number">What do we then but draw anew the model</li>
  <li class="number">In fewer offices, or at least desist</li>
  <li class="number">To build at all? Much more, in this great work</li>
  <li class="number">(Which is, almost, to pluck a kingdom down</li>
  <li class="number">And set another up), should we survey</li>
  <li class="number">The plot of situation and the model,</li>
  <li class="number">Consent upon a sure foundation,</li>
  <li class="number">Question surveyors, know our own estate,</li>
  <li class="number">How able such a work to undergo,</li>
  <li class="number">To weigh against his opposite; or else</li>
  <li class="number">We fortify in paper and in figures,</li>
  <li class="number">Using the names of men in stead of men,</li>
  <li class="number">Like one that draws the model of an house</li>
  <li class="number">Beyond his power to build it, who, half thorough,</li>
  <li class="number">Gives o’er, and leaves his part-created cost</li>
  <li class="number">A naked subject to the weeping clouds</li>
  <li class="number">And waste for churlish winter’s tyranny.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAST.">
  <li class="number">Grant that our hopes (yet likely of fair birth)</li>
  <li class="number">Should be still-born, and that we now possess’d</li>
  <li class="number">The utmost man of expectation,</li>
  <li class="number">I think we are so a body strong enough,</li>
  <li class="number">Even as we are, to equal with the King.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="L. BARD.">
  <li class="number">What, is the King but five and twenty thousand?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAST.">
  <li class="number">To us no more, nay, not so much, Lord Bardolph,</li>
  <li class="number">For his divisions, as the times do brawl,</li>
  <li class="number">Are in three heads: one power against the French,</li>
  <li class="number">And one against Glendower; perforce a third</li>
  <li class="number">Must take up us. So is the unfirm King</li>
  <li class="number">In three divided, and his coffers sound</li>
  <li class="number">With hollow poverty and emptiness.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ARCH.">
  <li class="number">That he should draw his several strengths together,</li>
  <li class="number">And come against us in full puissance,</li>
  <li class="number">Need not to be dreaded.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAST.">
  <li class="number">If he should do so,</li>
  <li class="number">To French and Welsh he leaves his back unarm’d,</li>
  <li class="number">They baying him at the heels. Never fear that.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="L. BARD.">
  <li class="number">Who is it like should lead his forces hither?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAST.">
  <li class="number">The Duke of Lancaster and Westmorland;</li>
  <li class="number">Against the Welsh, himself and Harry Monmouth;</li>
  <li class="number">But who is substituted against the French,</li>
  <li class="number">I have no certain notice.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ARCH.">
  <li class="number">Let us on!</li>
  <li class="number">And publish the occasion of our arms.</li>
  <li class="number">The commonwealth is sick of their own choice,</li>

  <li class="number">Hath he that buildeth on the vulgar heart.</li>
  <li class="number">O thou fond many, with what loud applause</li>
  <li class="number">Didst thou beat heaven with blessing Bullingbrook</li>
  <li class="number">Before he was what thou wouldst have him be!</li>
  <li class="number">And being now trimm’d in thine own desires,</li>
  <li class="number">Thou, beastly feeder, art so full of him,</li>
  <li class="number">That thou provok’st thyself to cast him up.</li>
  <li class="number">So, so, thou common dog, didst thou disgorge</li>
  <li class="number">Thy glutton bosom of the royal Richard,</li>
  <li class="number">And now thou wouldst eat thy dead vomit up,</li>
  <li class="number">And howl’st to find it. What trust is in these times?</li>
  <li class="number">They that, when Richard liv’d, would have him die,</li>
  <li class="number">Are now become enamor’d on his grave.</li>
  <li class="number">Thou, that threw’st dust upon his goodly head</li>
  <li class="number">When through proud London he came sighing on</li>
  <li class="number">After th’ admired heels of Bullingbrook,</li>
  <li class="number">Cri’st now, “O earth, yield us that king again,</li>
  <li class="number">And take thou this!” O thoughts of men accurs’d!</li>
  <li class="number">Past and to come seems best; things present worst.</li>

<h3>Scene 2</h3>

<h4>London. Another street.</h4>

<div class="stage-direction">
	Enter the Prince Henry, Poins, with other.
	
		PRINCE.
		POINS.
	
</div>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE.">
  <li class="number">Before God, I am exceeding weary.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POINS.">
  <li class="number">Is’t come to that? I had thought weariness durst not have attach’d one of so high blood.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE.">
  <li class="number">Faith, it does me, though it discolors the complexion of my greatness to acknowledge it. Doth it not show vildly in me to desire small beer?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POINS.">
  <li class="number">Why, a prince should not be so loosely studied as to remember so weak a composition.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE.">
  <li class="number">Belike then my appetite was not princely got, for, by my troth, I do now remember the poor creature, small beer. But indeed these humble considerations make me out of love with my greatness. What a disgrace is it to me to remember thy name, or to know thy face tomorrow, or to take note how many pair of silk stockings thou hast, viz., these, and those that were thy peach-color’d once, or to bear the inventory of thy shirts, as one for superfluity, and another for use! But that the tennis-court-keeper knows better than I, for it is a low ebb of linen with thee when thou keepest not racket there; as thou hast not done a great while, because the rest of the low countries have made a shift to eat up thy holland. And God knows whether those that bawl out the ruins of thy linen shall inherit his kingdom: but the midwives say the children are not in the fault, whereupon the world increases, and kindreds are mightily strengthen’d.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POINS.">
  <li class="number">How ill it follows, after you have labor’d so hard, you should talk so idlely! Tell me how many good young princes would do so, their fathers being so sick as yours at this time is.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE.">
  <li class="number">Shall I tell thee one thing, Poins?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POINS.">
  <li class="number">Yes, faith, and let it be an excellent good thing.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE.">
  <li class="number">It shall serve among wits of no higher breeding than thine.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POINS.">
  <li class="number">Go to, I stand the push of your one thing that you will tell.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE.">
  <li class="number">Marry, I tell thee it is not meet that I should be sad, now my father is sick, albeit I could tell to thee—as to one it pleases me, for fault of a better, to call my friend—I could be sad, and sad indeed too.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POINS.">
  <li class="number">Very hardly, upon such a subject.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE.">
  <li class="number">By this hand, thou thinkest me as far in the devil’s book as thou and Falstaff, for obduracy and persistency. Let the end try the man. But I tell thee, my heart bleeds inwardly that my father is so sick, and keeping such vile company as thou art hath in reason taken from me all ostentation of sorrow.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POINS.">
  <li class="number">The reason?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE.">
  <li class="number">What wouldst thou think of me if I should weep?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POINS.">
  <li class="number">I would think thee a most princely hypocrite.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE.">
  <li class="number">It would be every man’s thought, and thou art a blessed fellow to think as every man thinks. Never a man’s thought in the world keeps the road-way better than thine: every man would think me an hypocrite indeed. And what accites your most worshipful thought to think so?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POINS.">
  <li class="number">Why, because you have been so lewd and so much engraff’d to Falstaff.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE.">
  <li class="number">And to thee.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POINS.">
  <li class="number">By this light, I am well spoke on, I can hear it with mine own ears. The worst that they can say of me is that I am a second brother, and that I am a proper fellow of my hands, and those two things I confess I cannot help. By the mass, here comes Bardolph.</li>

  <li class="number">“The time will come, that foul sin, gathering head,</li>
  <li class="number">Shall break into corruption”: so went on,</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHAL.">
  <li class="number">By the mass, I was call’d any thing, and I would have done any thing indeed too, and roundly too. There was I, and little John Doit of Staffords hire, and black George Barnes, and Francis Pickbone, and Will Squele, a Cotsole man. You had not four such swingebucklers in all the Inns a’ Court again; and I may say to you, we knew where the <foreign xml:lang="it">bona robas</foreign> were and had the best of them all at commandment. Then was Jack Falstaff, now Sir John, a boy, and page to Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk.</li>

  <li class="number">This Sir John, cousin, that comes hither anon about soldiers?</li>

<ol data-speaker="SHAL.">
  <li class="number">The same Sir John, the very same.

<ol data-speaker="BARD.">

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHAL.">
  <li class="number">It is well said, in faith, sir, and it is well said indeed too. Better accommodated! It is good, yea indeed is it. Good phrases are surely, and ever were, very commendable. Accommodated! It comes of <foreign xml:lang="la">accommodo</foreign>, very good, a good phrase.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BARD.">
  <li class="number">Pardon, sir, I have heard the word. Phrase call you it? By this day, I know not the phrase, but I will maintain the word with my sword to be a soldier-like word, and a word of exceeding good command, by heaven. Accommodated: that is, when a man is, as they say, accommodated, or when a man is being whereby ’a may be thought to be accommodated—which is an excellent thing.</li>

And this same half-fac’d fellow, Shadow, give me this man. He presents no mark to the enemy, the foeman may with as great aim level at the edge of a penknife. And for a retreat, how swiftly will this Feeble the woman’s tailor run off! O, give me the spare men, and spare me the great ones. Put me a caliver into Wart’s hand, Bardolph.</li>

  <li class="number">As I return, I will fetch off these justices. I do see the bottom of Justice Shallow. Lord, Lord, how subject we old men are to this vice of lying! This same starv’d justice hath done nothing but prate to me of the wildness of his youth, and the feats he hath done about Turnbull Street, and every third word a lie, duer paid to the hearer than the Turk’s tribute. I do remember him at Clement’s Inn, like a man made after supper of a cheese-paring. When ’a was naked, he was for all the world like a fork’d redish, with a head fantastically carv’d upon it with a knife. ’A was so forlorn, that his dimensions to any thick sight were invisible. ’A was the very genius of famine, yet lecherous as a monkey, and the whores call’d him mandrake. ’A came ever in the rearward of the fashion, and sung those tunes to the overscutch’d huswives that he heard the carmen whistle, and sware they were his fancies or his good-nights. And now is this Vice’s dagger become a squire, and talks as familiarly of John a’ Gaunt as if he had been sworn brother to him, and I’ll be sworn ’a ne’er saw him but once in the Tilt-yard, and then he burst his head for crowding among the marshal’s men. I saw it, and told John a’ Gaunt he beat his own name, for you might have thrust him and all his apparel into an eel-skin. The case of a treble hoboy was a mansion for him, a court, and now has he land and beefs! Well, I’ll be acquainted with him if I return, and’t shall go hard but I’ll make him a philosopher’s two stones to me. If the young dace be a bait for the old pike, I see no reason in the law of nature but I may snap at him: let time shape, and there an end.</li>

  <li class="number">What doth concern your coming.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WEST.">
  <li class="number">Then, my lord,</li>
  <li class="number">Unto your Grace do I in chief address</li>
  <li class="number">The substance of my speech. If that rebellion</li>
  <li class="number">Came like itself, in base and abject routs,</li>
  <li class="number">Led on by bloody youth, guarded with rage,</li>
  <li class="number">And countenanc’d by boys and beggary—</li>
  <li class="number">I say, if damn’d commotion so appear’d</li>
  <li class="number">In his true, native, and most proper shape,</li>
  <li class="number">You, reverend father, and these noble lords</li>
  <li class="number">Had not been here to dress the ugly form</li>
  <li class="number">Of base and bloody insurrection</li>
  <li class="number">With your fair honors. You, Lord Archbishop,</li>
  <li class="number">Whose see is by a civil peace maintain’d,</li>
  <li class="number">Whose beard the silver hand of peace hath touch’d,</li>
  <li class="number">Whose learning and good letters peace hath tutor’d,</li>
  <li class="number">Whose white investments figure innocence,</li>
  <li class="number">The dove, and very blessed spirit of peace,</li>
  <li class="number">Wherefore do you so ill translate yourself</li>
  <li class="number">Out of the speech of peace that bears such grace,</li>
  <li class="number">Into the harsh and boist’rous tongue of war?</li>
  <li class="number">Turning your books to graves, your ink to blood,</li>
  <li class="number">Your pens to lances, and your tongue divine</li>
  <li class="number">To a loud trumpet and a point of war?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ARCH.">
  <li class="number">Wherefore do I this? So the question stands.</li>
  <li class="number">Briefly, to this end: we are all diseas’d,</li>
  <li class="number">And with our surfeiting and wanton hours</li>
  <li class="number">Have brought ourselves into a burning fever,</li>
  <li class="number">And we must bleed for it; of which disease</li>
  <li class="number">Our late King Richard (being infected) died.</li>
  <li class="number">But, my most noble Lord of Westmorland,</li>
  <li class="number">I take not on me here as a physician,</li>
  <li class="number">Nor do I as an enemy to peace</li>
  <li class="number">Troop in the throngs of military men;</li>
  <li class="number">But rather show a while like fearful war</li>
  <li class="number">To diet rank minds sick of happiness,</li>
  <li class="number">And purge th’ obstructions which begin to stop</li>
  <li class="number">Our very veins of life. Hear me more plainly.</li>
  <li class="number">I have in equal balance justly weigh’d</li>
  <li class="number">What wrongs our arms may do, what wrongs we suffer,</li>
  <li class="number">And find our griefs heavier than our offenses.</li>
  <li class="number">We see which way the stream of time doth run,</li>
  <li class="number">And are enforc’d from our most quiet there</li>
  <li class="number">By the rough torrent of occasion,</li>
  <li class="number">And have the summary of all our griefs</li>
  <li class="number">(When time shall serve) to show in articles;</li>
  <li class="number">Which long ere this we offer’d to the King,</li>
  <li class="number">And might by no suit gain our audience.</li>
  <li class="number">When we are wrong’d and would unfold our griefs,</li>
  <li class="number">We are denied access unto his person</li>
  <li class="number">Even by those men that most have done us wrong.</li>
  <li class="number">The dangers of the days but newly gone,</li>
  <li class="number">Whose memory is written on the earth</li>
  <li class="number">With yet appearing blood, and the examples</li>
  <li class="number">Of every minute’s instance (present now)</li>
  <li class="number">Hath put us in these ill-beseeming arms,</li>
  <li class="number">Not to break peace, or any branch of it,</li>
  <li class="number">But to establish here a peace indeed,</li>
  <li class="number">Concurring both in name and quality.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WEST.">
  <li class="number">When ever yet was your appeal denied?</li>
  <li class="number">Wherein have you been galled by the King?</li>

<ol data-speaker="WEST.">
  <li class="number">O, my good Lord Mowbray,</li>

  <li class="number">And you shall say, indeed, it is the time,</li>
  <li class="number">And not the King, that doth you injuries.</li>
  <li class="number">Yet, for your part, it not appears to me,</li>
  <li class="number">Either from the King or in the present time,</li>
  <li class="number">That you should have an inch of any ground</li>
  <li class="number">To build a grief on. Were you not restor’d</li>
  <li class="number">To all the Duke of Norfolk’s signories,</li>
  <li class="number">Your noble and right well-rememb’red father’s?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOWB.">
  <li class="number">What thing, in honor, had my father lost,</li>
  <li class="number">That need to be reviv’d and breath’d in me?</li>
  <li class="number">The King that lov’d him, as the state stood then,</li>
  <li class="number">Was force perforce compell’d to banish him;</li>
  <li class="number">And then that Henry Bullingbrook and he,</li>
  <li class="number">Being mounted and both roused in their seats,</li>
  <li class="number">Their neighing coursers daring of the spur,</li>
  <li class="number">Their armed staves in charge, their beavers down,</li>
  <li class="number">Their eyes of fire sparkling through sights of steel,</li>
  <li class="number">And the loud trumpet blowing them together;</li>
  <li class="number">Then, then, when there was nothing could have stay’d</li>
  <li class="number">My father from the breast of Bullingbrook,</li>
  <li class="number">O, when the King did throw his warder down</li>
  <li class="number">(His own life hung upon the staff he threw),</li>
  <li class="number">Then threw he down himself and all their lives</li>
  <li class="number">That by indictment and by dint of sword</li>
  <li class="number">Have since miscarried under Bullingbrook.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WEST.">
  <li class="number">You speak, Lord Mowbray, now you know not what.</li>
  <li class="number">The Earl of Herford was reputed then</li>
  <li class="number">In England the most valiant gentleman.</li>
  <li class="number">Who knows on whom fortune would then have smil’d?</li>
  <li class="number">But if your father had been victor there,</li>
  <li class="number">He ne’er had borne it out of Coventry;</li>
  <li class="number">For all the country in a general voice</li>
  <li class="number">Cried hate upon him; and all their prayers and love</li>
  <li class="number">Were set on Herford, whom they doted on</li>
  <li class="number">And bless’d and grac’d and did, more than the King—</li>
  <li class="number">But this is mere digression from my purpose.</li>
  <li class="number">Here come I from our princely general</li>
  <li class="number">To know your griefs, to tell you from his Grace</li>
  <li class="number">That he will give you audience, and wherein</li>

  <li class="number">That might so much as think you enemies.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOWB.">

<ol data-speaker="WEST.">
  <li class="number">Mowbray, you overween to take it so;</li>
  <li class="number">This offer comes from mercy, not from fear.</li>
  <li class="number">For lo, within a ken our army lies:</li>
  <li class="number">Upon mine honor, all too confident</li>

<ol data-speaker="MOWB.">
  <li class="number">Well, by my will we shall admit no parley.</li>

  <li class="number">And so to you, Lord Hastings, and to all.</li>
  <li class="number">My Lord of York, it better show’d with you</li>
  <li class="number">When that your flock, assembled by the bell,</li>

  <li class="number">Than now to see you here an iron man, talking,</li>

  <li class="number">That man that sits within a monarch’s heart</li>

  <li class="number">Would he abuse the countenance of the King,</li>
  <li class="number">Alack, what mischiefs might he set abroach</li>
  <li class="number">In shadow of such greatness? With you, Lord Bishop,</li>
  <li class="number">It is even so. Who hath not heard it spoken</li>
  <li class="number">How deep you were within the books of God?</li>
  <li class="number">To us the speaker in his parliament,</li>
  <li class="number">To us th’ imagin’d voice of God himself,</li>
  <li class="number">The very opener and intelligencer</li>
  <li class="number">Between the grace, the sanctities of heaven,</li>

  <li class="number">I would you had the wit, ’twere better than your dukedom. Good faith, this same young sober-blooded boy doth not love me, nor a man cannot make him laugh, but that’s no marvel, he drinks no wine. There’s never none of these demure boys come to any proof, for thin drink doth so over-cool their blood, and making many fish-meals, that they fall into a kind of male green-sickness, and then when they marry, they get wenches. They are generally fools and cowards, which some of us should be too, but for inflammation. A good sherris-sack hath a twofold operation in it. It ascends me into the brain, dries me there all the foolish and dull and crudy vapors which environ it, makes it apprehensive, quick, forgetive, full of nimble, fiery, and delectable shapes, which deliver’d o’er to the voice, the tongue, which is the birth, becomes excellent wit. The second property of your excellent sherris is the warming of the blood, which before (cold and settled) left the liver white and pale, which is the badge of pusillanimity and cowardice; but the sherris warms it, and makes it course from the inwards to the parts’ extremes. It illumineth the face, which as a beacon gives warning to all the rest of this little kingdom, man, to arm, and then the vital commoners and inland petty spirits muster me all to their captain, the heart, who great and puff’d up with this retinue, doth any deed of courage; and this valor comes of sherris. So that skill in the weapon is nothing without sack (for that sets it a-work) and learning a mere hoard of gold kept by a devil, till sack commences it and sets it in act and use. Hereof comes it that Prince Harry is valiant, for the cold blood he did naturally inherit of his father, he hath, like lean, sterile, and bare land, manur’d, husbanded, and till’d with excellent endeavor of drinking good and good store of fertile sherris, that he is become very hot and valiant. If I had a thousand sons, the first humane principle I would teach them should be, to forswear thin potations and to addict themselves to sack.</li>

  <li class="number">Humphrey, my son of Gloucester,</li>
  <li class="number">Where is the Prince your brother?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li class="number">I think he’s gone to hunt, my lord, at Windsor.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING.">
  <li class="number">And how accompanied?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li class="number">I do not know, my lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING.">
  <li class="number">Is not his brother Thomas of Clarence with him?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li class="number">No, my good lord, he is in presence here.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLAR.">
  <li class="number">What would my lord and father?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING.">
  <li class="number">Nothing but well to thee, Thomas of Clarence.</li>
  <li class="number">How chance thou art not with the Prince thy brother?</li>
  <li class="number">He loves thee, and thou dost neglect him, Thomas.</li>
  <li class="number">Thou hast a better place in his affection</li>
  <li class="number">Than all thy brothers. Cherish it, my boy;</li>
  <li class="number">And noble offices thou mayst effect</li>
  <li class="number">Of mediation, after I am dead,</li>
  <li class="number">Between his greatness and thy other brethren.</li>
  <li class="number">Therefore omit him not, blunt not his love,</li>
  <li class="number">Nor lose the good advantage of his grace</li>
  <li class="number">By seeming cold or careless of his will,</li>
  <li class="number">For he is gracious if he be observ’d,</li>
  <li class="number">He hath a tear for pity, and a hand</li>
  <li class="number">Open as day for meting charity;</li>
  <li class="number">Yet notwithstanding, being incens’d, he is flint,</li>
  <li class="number">As humorous as winter, and as sudden</li>
  <li class="number">As flaws congealed in the spring of day.</li>
  <li class="number">His temper therefore must be well observ’d.</li>
  <li class="number">Chide him for faults, and do it reverently,</li>
  <li class="number">When you perceive his blood inclin’d to mirth;</li>
  <li class="number">But, being moody, give him time and scope,</li>
  <li class="number">Till that his passions, like a whale on ground,</li>
  <li class="number">Confound themselves with working. Learn this, Thomas,</li>
  <li class="number">And thou shalt prove a shelter to thy friends,</li>
  <li class="number">A hoop of gold to bind thy brothers in,</li>
  <li class="number">That the united vessel of their blood,</li>
  <li class="number">Mingled with venom of suggestion</li>
  <li class="number">(As, force perforce, the age will pour it in),</li>
  <li class="number">Shall never leak, though it do work as strong</li>
  <li class="number">As aconitum or rash gunpowder.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLAR.">
  <li class="number">I shall observe him with all care and love.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING.">
  <li class="number">Why art thou not at Windsor with him, Thomas?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLAR.">
  <li class="number">He is not there today, he dines in London.</li>

<ol data-speaker="KING.">
  <li class="number">And how accompanied? Canst thou tell that?</li>

<ol data-speaker="KING.">
  <li class="number">Most subject is the fattest soil to weeds,</li>
  <li class="number">And he, the noble image of my youth,</li>
  <li class="number">Is overspread with them; therefore my grief</li>
  <li class="number">Stretches itself beyond the hour of death.</li>
  <li class="number">The blood weeps from my heart when I do shape,</li>
  <li class="number">In forms imaginary, th’ unguided days</li>
  <li class="number">And rotten times that you shall look upon,</li>
  <li class="number">When I am sleeping with my ancestors.</li>
  <li class="number">For when his headstrong riot hath no curb,</li>
  <li class="number">When rage and hot blood are his counsellors,</li>
  <li class="number">When means and lavish manners meet together,</li>

<ol data-speaker="WAR.">
  <li class="number">My gracious lord, you look beyond him quite:</li>

  <li class="number">Be look’d upon and learnt, which once attain’d,</li>
  <li class="number">Your Highness knows, comes to no further use</li>
  <li class="number">But to be known and hated. So, like gross terms,</li>
  <li class="number">The Prince will in the perfectness of time</li>
  <li class="number">Cast off his followers, and their memory</li>
  <li class="number">Shall as a pattern or a measure live,</li>

  <li class="number">I met this crown, and I myself know well</li>
  <li class="number">How troublesome it sate upon my head.</li>
  <li class="number">To thee it shall descend with better quiet,</li>
  <li class="number">Better opinion, better confirmation,</li>
  <li class="number">For all the soil of the achievement goes</li>
  <li class="number">With me into the earth. It seem’d in me</li>
  <li class="number">But as an honor snatch’d with boist’rous hand,</li>
  <li class="number">And I had many living to upbraid</li>
  <li class="number">My gain of it by their assistances,</li>
  <li class="number">Which daily grew to quarrel and to bloodshed,</li>
  <li class="number">Wounding supposed peace. All these bold fears</li>
  <li class="number">Thou seest with peril I have answered;</li>
  <li class="number">For all my reign hath been but as a scene</li>
  <li class="number">Acting that argument. And now my death</li>
  <li class="number">Changes the mood, for what in me was purchas’d</li>
  <li class="number">Falls upon thee in a more fairer sort;</li>
  <li class="number">So thou the garland wear’st successively.</li>
  <li class="number">Yet though thou stand’st more sure than I could do,</li>
  <li class="number">Thou art not firm enough, since griefs are green,</li>
  <li class="number">And all my friends, which thou must make thy friends,</li>
  <li class="number">Have but their stings and teeth newly ta’en out;</li>
  <li class="number">By whose fell working I was first advanc’d,</li>
  <li class="number">And by whose power I well might lodge a fear</li>
  <li class="number">To be again displac’d; which to avoid,</li>
  <li class="number">I cut them off, and had a purpose now</li>
  <li class="number">To lead out many to the Holy Land,</li>
  <li class="number">Lest rest and lying still might make them look</li>
  <li class="number">Too near unto my state. Therefore, my Harry,</li>
  <li class="number">Be it thy course to busy giddy minds</li>
  <li class="number">With foreign quarrels, that action, hence borne out,</li>
  <li class="number">May waste the memory of the former days.</li>
  <li class="number">More would I, but my lungs are wasted so</li>
  <li class="number">That strength of speech is utterly denied me.</li>
  <li class="number">How I came by the crown, O God forgive,</li>
  <li class="number">And grant it may with thee in true peace live!</li>

I have serv’d your worship truly, sir, this eight years; and I cannot once or twice in a quarter bear out a knave against an honest man, I have little credit with your worship.

  <li class="number">If I were saw’d into quantities, I should make four dozen of such bearded hermits’ staves as Master Shallow. It is a wonderful thing to see the semblable coherence of his men’s spirits and his. They, by observing him, do bear themselves like foolish justices; he, by conversing with them, is turn’d into a justice-like servingman. Their spirits are so married in conjunction with the participation of society that they flock together in consent, like so many wild geese. If I had a suit to Master Shallow, I would humor his men with the imputation of being near their master; if to his men, I would curry with Master Shallow that no man could better command his servants. It is certain that either wise bearing or ignorant carriage is caught, as men take diseases, one of another; therefore let men take heed of their company. I will devise matter enough out of this Shallow to keep Prince Harry in continual laughter the wearing out of six fashions, which is four terms, or two actions, and ’a shall laugh without intervallums. O, it is much that a lie with a slight oath and a jest with a sad brow will do with a fellow that never had the ache in his shoulders! O, you shall see him laugh till his face be like a wet cloak ill laid up.</li>

  <li class="number">This new and gorgeous garment, majesty,</li>

  <li class="number">This is the English, not the Turkish court,</li>
  <li class="number">Not Amurath an Amurath succeeds,</li>
  <li class="number">But Harry Harry. Yet be sad, good brothers,</li>

  <li class="number">Sorrow so royally in you appears</li>
  <li class="number">That I will deeply put the fashion on</li>

  <li class="number">But entertain no more of it, good brothers,</li>

  <li class="number">Let me but bear your love, I’ll bear your cares.</li>
  <li class="number">Yet weep that Harry’s dead, and so will I,</li>

<ol data-speaker="CH. JUST.">
  <li class="number">I then did use the person of your father,</li>

  <li class="number">And did commit you. If the deed were ill,</li>
  <li class="number">Be you contented, wearing now the garland,</li>
  <li class="number">To have a son set your decrees at nought?</li>
  <li class="number">To pluck down justice from your awful bench?</li>
  <li class="number">To trip the course of law and blunt the sword</li>
  <li class="number">That guards the peace and safety of your person?</li>
  <li class="number">Nay more, to spurn at your most royal image,</li>
  <li class="number">And mock your workings in a second body?</li>
  <li class="number">Question your royal thoughts, make the case yours:</li>
  <li class="number">Be now the father and propose a son,</li>
  <li class="number">Hear your own dignity so much profan’d,</li>
  <li class="number">See your most dreadful laws so loosely slighted,</li>
  <li class="number">Behold yourself so by a son disdained;</li>
  <li class="number">And then imagine me taking your part,</li>
  <li class="number">And in your power soft silencing your son.</li>
  <li class="number">After this cold considerance, sentence me,</li>
  <li class="number">And as you are a king, speak in your state</li>
  <li class="number">What I have done that misbecame my place,</li>
  <li class="number">My person, or my liege’s sovereignty.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRINCE.">

  <li class="number">Offend you and obey you, as I did.</li>
  <li class="number">So shall I live to speak my father’s words:</li>
  <li class="number">“Happy am I, that have a man so bold,</li>
  <li class="number">That dares do justice on my proper son;</li>
  <li class="number">And not less happy, having such a son</li>
  <li class="number">That would deliver up his greatness so</li>
  <li class="number">Into the hands of justice.” You did commit me;</li>
  <li class="number">For which I do commit into your hand</li>
  <li class="number">Th’ unstained sword that you have us’d to bear,</li>
  <li class="number">With this remembrance, that you use the same</li>
  <li class="number">With the like bold, just, and impartial spirit</li>
  <li class="number">As you have done ’gainst me. There is my hand.</li>
  <li class="number">You shall be as a father to my youth,</li>
  <li class="number">My voice shall sound as you do prompt mine ear,</li>
  <li class="number">And I will stoop and humble my intents</li>
  <li class="number">To your well-practic’d wise directions.</li>
  <li class="number">And, princes all, believe me, I beseech you,</li>
  <li class="number">My father is gone wild into his grave;</li>
  <li class="number">For in his tomb lie my affections,</li>
  <li class="number">And with his spirits sadly I survive,</li>
  <li class="number">To mock the expectation of the world,</li>
  <li class="number">To frustrate prophecies, and to rase out</li>
  <li class="number">Rotten opinion, who hath writ me down</li>
  <li class="number">After my seeming. The tide of blood in me</li>
  <li class="number">Hath proudly flow’d in vanity till now;</li>
  <li class="number">Now doth it turn and ebb back to the sea,</li>
  <li class="number">Where it shall mingle with the state of floods,</li>
  <li class="number">And flow henceforth in formal majesty.</li>
  <li class="number">Now call we our high court of parliament,</li>
  <li class="number">And let us choose such limbs of noble counsel</li>
  <li class="number">That the great body of our state may go</li>
  <li class="number">In equal rank with the best govern’d nation,</li>
  <li class="number">That war, or peace, or both at once, may be</li>
  <li class="number">As things acquainted and familiar to us,</li>
  <li class="number">In which you, father, shall have foremost hand.</li>
  <li class="number">Our coronation done, we will accite</li>
  <li class="number">(As I before rememb’red) all our state,</li>
  <li class="number">And (God consigning to my good intents)</li>
