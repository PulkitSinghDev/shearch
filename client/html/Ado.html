<h3>Scene 1</h3>

<h4>Messina. Before Leonato’s house.</h4>

<div class="stage-direction">
	Enter Leonato, governor of Messina, Hero his daughter, and Beatrice his niece, with a Messenger.
	
		LEON.
		HERO.
		BEAT.
		MESS.
	
</div>

<ol data-speaker="LEON.">
  <li class="number">I learn in this letter that Don Pedro of Arragon comes this night to Messina.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MESS.">
  <li class="number">He is very near by this, he was not three leagues off when I left him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEON.">
  <li class="number">How many gentlemen have you lost in this action?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MESS.">
  <li class="number">But few of any sort, and none of name.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEON.">
  <li class="number">A victory is twice itself when the achiever brings home full numbers. I find here that Don Pedro hath bestow’d much honor on a young Florentine call’d Claudio.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MESS.">
  <li class="number">Much deserv’d on his part, and equally rememb’red by Don Pedro. He hath borne himself beyond the promise of his age, doing in the figure of a lamb the feats of a lion. He hath indeed better bett’red expectation than you must expect of me to tell you how.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEON.">
  <li class="number">He hath an uncle here in Messina will be very much glad of it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MESS.">
  <li class="number">I have already deliver’d him letters, and there appears much joy in him, even so much that joy could not show itself modest enough without a badge of bitterness.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEON.">
  <li class="number">Did he break out into tears?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MESS.">
  <li class="number">In great measure.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEON.">
  <li class="number">A kind overflow of kindness. There are no faces truer than those that are so wash’d. How much better is it to weep at joy than to joy at weeping!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BEAT.">
  <li class="number">I pray you, is <foreign xml:lang="it">Signior</foreign> Mountanto return’d from the wars or no?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MESS.">
  <li class="number">I know none of that name, lady. There was none such in the army of any sort.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEON.">
  <li class="number">What is he that you ask for, niece?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HERO.">
  <li class="number">My cousin means <foreign xml:lang="it">Signior</foreign> Benedick of Padua.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MESS.">
  <li class="number">O, he’s return’d, and as pleasant as ever he was.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BEAT.">
  <li class="number">He set up his bills here in Messina, and challeng’d Cupid at the flight, and my uncle’s fool, reading the challenge, subscrib’d for Cupid, and challeng’d him at the burbolt. I pray you, how many hath he kill’d and eaten in these wars? But how many hath he kill’d? For indeed I promis’d to eat all of his killing.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEON.">
  <li class="number">Faith, niece, you tax <foreign xml:lang="it">Signior</foreign> Benedick too much, but he’ll be meet with you, I doubt it not.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MESS.">
  <li class="number">He hath done good service, lady, in these wars.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BEAT.">
  <li class="number">You had musty victual, and he hath holp to eat it. He is a very valiant trencherman, he hath an excellent stomach.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MESS.">
  <li class="number">And a good soldier too, lady.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BEAT.">
  <li class="number">And a good soldier to a lady, but what is he to a lord?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MESS.">
  <li class="number">A lord to a lord, a man to a man, stuff’d with all honorable virtues.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BEAT.">
  <li class="number">It is so indeed, he is no less than a stuff’d man. But for the stuffing—well, we are all mortal.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEON.">
  <li class="number">You must not, sir, mistake my niece. There is a kind of merry war betwixt <foreign xml:lang="it">Signior</foreign> Benedick and her; they never meet but there’s a skirmish of wit between them.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BEAT.">
  <li class="number">Alas, he gets nothing by that. In our last conflict four of his five wits went halting off, and now is the whole man govern’d with one; so that if he have wit enough to keep himself warm, let him bear it for a difference between himself and his horse, for it is all the wealth that he hath left to be known a reasonable creature. Who is his companion now? He hath every month a new sworn brother.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MESS.">
  <li class="number">Is’t possible?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BEAT.">
  <li class="number">Very easily possible. He wears his faith but as the fashion of his hat: it ever changes with the next block.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MESS.">
  <li class="number">I see, lady, the gentleman is not in your books.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BEAT.">
  <li class="number">No, and he were, I would burn my study. But I pray you, who is his companion? Is there no young squarer now that will make a voyage with him to the devil?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MESS.">
  <li class="number">He is most in the company of the right noble Claudio.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BEAT.">
  <li class="number">O Lord, he will hang upon him like a disease; he is sooner caught than the pestilence, and the taker runs presently mad. God help the noble Claudio! If he have caught the Benedick, it will cost him a thousand pound ere ’a be cur’d.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MESS.">
  <li class="number">I will hold friends with you, lady.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BEAT.">
  <li class="number">Do, good friend.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEON.">
  <li class="number">You will never run mad, niece.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BEAT.">
  <li class="number">No, not till a hot January.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MESS.">
  <li class="number">Don Pedro is approach’d.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">
	Enter Don Pedro, Claudio, Benedick, Balthasar, and Don John the Bastard.
	
		D. PEDRO.

		D. JOHN.
	
</div>

<ol data-speaker="D. PEDRO.">
  <li class="number">Good <foreign xml:lang="it">Signior</foreign> Leonato, are you come to meet your trouble? The fashion of the world is to avoid cost, and you encounter it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEON.">
  <li class="number">Never came trouble to my house in the likeness of your Grace, for trouble being gone, comfort should remain; but when you depart from me, sorrow abides and happiness takes his leave.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="D. PEDRO.">
  <li class="number">You embrace your charge too willingly. I think this is your daughter.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEON.">
  <li class="number">Her mother hath many times told me so.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BENE.">
  <li class="number">Were you in doubt, sir, that you ask’d her?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEON.">
  <li class="number"><foreign xml:lang="it">Signior</foreign> Benedick, no, for then were you a child.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="D. PEDRO.">
  <li class="number">You have it full, Benedick. We may guess by this what you are, being a man. Truly the lady fathers herself. Be happy, lady, for you are like an honorable father.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BENE.">
  <li class="number">If <foreign xml:lang="it">Signior</foreign> Leonato be her father, she would not have his head on her shoulders for all Messina, as like him as she is.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BEAT.">
  <li class="number">I wonder that you will still be talking, <foreign xml:lang="it">Signior</foreign> Benedick, nobody marks you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BENE.">
  <li class="number">What, my dear Lady Disdain! Are you yet living?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BEAT.">
  <li class="number">Is it possible disdain should die while she hath such meet food to feed it as <foreign xml:lang="it">Signior</foreign> Benedick? Courtesy itself must convert to disdain, if you come in her presence.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BENE.">
  <li class="number">Then is courtesy a turncoat. But it is certain I am lov’d of all ladies, only you excepted; and I would I could find in my heart that I had not a hard heart, for truly I love none.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BEAT.">
  <li class="number">A dear happiness to women, they would else have been troubled with a pernicious suitor. I thank God and my cold blood, I am of your humor for that: I had rather hear my dog bark at a crow than a man swear he loves me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BENE.">
  <li class="number">God keep your ladyship still in that mind! So some gentleman or other shall scape a predestinate scratch’d face.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BEAT.">
  <li class="number">Scratching could not make it worse, and ’twere such a face as yours were.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BENE.">
  <li class="number">Well, you are a rare parrot-teacher.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BEAT.">
  <li class="number">A bird of my tongue is better than a beast of yours.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BENE.">
  <li class="number">I would my horse had the speed of your tongue, and so good a continuer. But keep your way a’ God’s name, I have done.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BEAT.">
  <li class="number">You always end with a jade’s trick, I know you of old.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="D. PEDRO.">
  <li class="number">That is the sum of all: Leonato—<foreign xml:lang="it">Signior</foreign> Claudio and <foreign xml:lang="it">Signior</foreign> Benedick—my dear friend Leonato hath invited you all. I tell him we shall stay here at the least a month, and he heartily prays some occasion may detain us longer. I dare swear he is no hypocrite, but prays from his heart.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLAUD.">
  <li class="number">Benedick, didst thou note the daughter of <foreign xml:lang="it">Signior</foreign> Leonato?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BENE.">
  <li class="number">I noted her not, but I look’d on her.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLAUD.">
  <li class="number">Is she not a modest young lady?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BENE.">
  <li class="number">Do you question me, as an honest man should do, for my simple true judgment? Or would you have me speak after my custom, as being a profess’d tyrant to their sex?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLAUD.">
  <li class="number">No, I pray thee speak in sober judgment.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BENE.">
  <li class="number">Why, i’ faith, methinks she’s too low for a high praise, too brown for a fair praise, and too little for a great praise; only this commendation I can afford her, that were she other than she is, she were unhandsome, and being no other but as she is, I do not like her.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLAUD.">
  <li class="number">Thou thinkest I am in sport. I pray thee tell me truly how thou lik’st her.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BENE.">
  <li class="number">Would you buy her, that you inquire after her?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLAUD.">
  <li class="number">Can the world buy such a jewel?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BENE.">
  <li class="number">Yea, and a case to put it into. But speak you this with a sad brow? Or do you play the flouting Jack, to tell us Cupid is a good hare-finder and Vulcan a rare carpenter? Come, in what key shall a man take you to go in the song?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLAUD.">
  <li class="number">In mine eye, she is the sweetest lady that ever I look’d on.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BENE.">
  <li class="number">I can see yet without spectacles, and I see no such matter. There’s her cousin, and she were not possess’d with a fury, exceeds her as much in beauty as the first of May doth the last of December. But I hope you have no intent to turn husband, have you?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLAUD.">
  <li class="number">I would scarce trust myself, though I had sworn the contrary, if Hero would be my wife.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BENE.">
  <li class="number">Is’t come to this? In faith, hath not the world one man but he will wear his cap with suspicion? Shall I never see a bachelor of threescore again? Go to, i’ faith, and thou wilt needs thrust thy neck into a yoke, wear the print of it, and sigh away Sundays. Look, Don Pedro is return’d to seek you.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">
	Enter Don Pedro.
	
		D. PEDRO.
	
</div>

<ol data-speaker="D. PEDRO.">
  <li class="number">What secret hath held you here, that you follow’d not to Leonato’s?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BENE.">
  <li class="number">I would your Grace would constrain me to tell.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="D. PEDRO.">
  <li class="number">I charge thee on thy allegiance.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BENE.">
  <li class="number">You hear, Count Claudio, I can be secret as a dumb man; I would have you think so; but on my allegiance, mark you this, on my allegiance, he is in love. With who? Now that is your Grace’s part. Mark how short his answer is: with Hero, Leonato’s short daughter.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLAUD.">
  <li class="number">If this were so, so were it utt’red.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BENE.">
  <li class="number">Like the old tale, my lord: “It is not so, nor ’twas not so, but indeed, God forbid it should be so.”</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLAUD.">
  <li class="number">If my passion change not shortly, God forbid it should be otherwise.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="D. PEDRO.">
  <li class="number">Amen, if you love her, for the lady is very well worthy.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLAUD.">
  <li class="number">You speak this to fetch me in, my lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="D. PEDRO.">
  <li class="number">By my troth, I speak my thought.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLAUD.">
  <li class="number">And in faith, my lord, I spoke mine.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BENE.">
  <li class="number">And by my two faiths and troths, my lord, I spoke mine.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLAUD.">
  <li class="number">That I love her, I feel.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="D. PEDRO.">
  <li class="number">That she is worthy, I know.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BENE.">
  <li class="number">That I neither feel how she should be lov’d, nor know how she should be worthy, is the opinion that fire cannot melt out of me; I will die in it at the stake.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="D. PEDRO.">
  <li class="number">Thou wast ever an obstinate heretic in the despite of beauty.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLAUD.">
  <li class="number">And never could maintain his part but in the force of his will.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BENE.">
  <li class="number">That a woman conceiv’d me, I thank her; that she brought me up, I likewise give her most humble thanks; but that I will have a rechate winded in my forehead, or hang my bugle in an invisible baldrick, all women shall pardon me. Because I will not do them the wrong to mistrust any, I will do myself the right to trust none; and the fine is (for the which I may go the finer), I will live a bachelor.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="D. PEDRO.">
  <li class="number">I shall see thee, ere I die, look pale with love.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BENE.">
  <li class="number">With anger, with sickness, or with hunger, my lord, not with love. Prove that ever I lose more blood with love than I will get again with drinking, pick out mine eyes with a ballad-maker’s pen, and hang me up at the door of a brothel-house for the sign of blind Cupid.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="D. PEDRO.">
  <li class="number">Well, if ever thou dost fall from this faith, thou wilt prove a notable argument.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BENE.">
  <li class="number">If I do, hang me in a bottle like a cat, and shoot at me, and he that hits me, let him be clapp’d on the shoulder, and call’d Adam.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="D. PEDRO.">
  <li class="number">Well, as time shall try:</li>
  <li class="number">“In time the savage bull doth bear the yoke.”</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BENE.">
  <li class="number">The savage bull may, but if ever the sensible Benedick bear it, pluck off the bull’s horns, and set them in my forehead, and let me be vildly painted, and in such great letters as they write “Here is good horse to hire,” let them signify under my sign, “Here you may see Benedick the married man.”</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLAUD.">
  <li class="number">If this should ever happen, thou wouldst be horn-mad.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="D. PEDRO.">
  <li class="number">Nay, if Cupid have not spent all his quiver in Venice, thou wilt quake for this shortly.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BENE.">
  <li class="number">I look for an earthquake too then.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="D. PEDRO.">
  <li class="number">Well, you will temporize with the hours. In the mean time, good <foreign xml:lang="it">Signior</foreign> Benedick, repair to Leonato’s, commend me to him, and tell him I will not fail him at supper, for indeed he hath made great preparation.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BENE.">
  <li class="number">I have almost matter enough in me for such an embassage, and so I commit you—</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLAUD.">
  <li class="number">To the tuition of God. From my house—if I had it—</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="D. PEDRO.">
  <li class="number">The sixth of July. Your loving friend, Benedick.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BENE.">
  <li class="number">Nay, mock not, mock not. The body of your discourse is sometime guarded with fragments, and the guards are but slightly basted on neither. Ere you flout old ends any further, examine your conscience, and so I leave you.</li>
</ol>

  <li class="number">My love is thine to teach; teach it but how,</li>
  <li class="number">And thou shalt see how apt it is to learn</li>
  <li class="number">Any hard lesson that may do thee good.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLAUD.">
  <li class="number">Hath Leonato any son, my lord?</li>

<ol data-speaker="D. PEDRO.">
  <li class="number">No child but Hero, she’s his only heir.</li>
  <li class="number">Dost thou affect her, Claudio?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLAUD.">
  <li class="number">O my lord,</li>
  <li class="number">When you went onward on this ended action,</li>
  <li class="number">I look’d upon her with a soldier’s eye,</li>
  <li class="number">That lik’d, but had a rougher task in hand</li>
  <li class="number">Than to drive liking to the name of love.</li>
  <li class="number">But now I am return’d, and that war-thoughts</li>
  <li class="number">Have left their places vacant, in their rooms</li>
  <li class="number">Come thronging soft and delicate desires,</li>
  <li class="number">All prompting me how fair young Hero is,</li>
  <li class="number">Saying I lik’d her ere I went to wars.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="D. PEDRO.">
  <li class="number">Thou wilt be like a lover presently,</li>
  <li class="number">And tire the hearer with a book of words.</li>
  <li class="number">If thou dost love fair Hero, cherish it,</li>
  <li class="number">And I will break with her, and with her father,</li>
  <li class="number">And thou shalt have her. Was’t not to this end</li>
  <li class="number">That thou began’st to twist so fine a story?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLAUD.">
  <li class="number">How sweetly you do minister to love,</li>
  <li class="number">That know love’s grief by his complexion!</li>
  <li class="number">But lest my liking might too sudden seem,</li>
  <li class="number">I would have salv’d it with a longer treatise.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="D. PEDRO.">
  <li class="number">What need the bridge much broader than the flood?</li>
  <li class="number">The fairest grant is the necessity.</li>
  <li class="number">Look what will serve is fit: ’tis once, thou lovest,</li>
  <li class="number">And I will fit thee with the remedy.</li>
  <li class="number">I know we shall have reveling tonight;</li>
  <li class="number">I will assume thy part in some disguise,</li>
  <li class="number">And tell fair Hero I am Claudio,</li>
  <li class="number">And in her bosom I’ll unclasp my heart,</li>
  <li class="number">And take her hearing prisoner with the force</li>
  <li class="number">And strong encounter of my amorous tale;</li>
  <li class="number">Then after to her father will I break,</li>

  <li class="number">How now, brother, where is my cousin, your son? Hath he provided this music?</li>

<ol data-speaker="ANT.">
  <li class="number">He is very busy about it. But, brother, I can tell you strange news that you yet dreamt not of.</li>

<ol data-speaker="LEON.">
  <li class="number">Are they good?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANT.">
  <li class="number">As the event stamps them, but they have a good cover; they show well outward. The Prince and Count Claudio, walking in a thick-pleach’d alley in mine orchard, were thus much overheard by a man of mine. The Prince discover’d to Claudio that he lov’d my niece your daughter, and meant to acknowledge it this night in a dance; and if he found her accordant, he meant to take the present time by the top, and instantly break with you of it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEON.">
  <li class="number">Hath the fellow any wit that told you this?</li>

<ol data-speaker="LEON.">
  <li class="number">No, no, we will hold it as a dream till it appear itself; but I will acquaint my daughter withal, that she may be the better prepar’d for an answer, if peradventure this be true. Go you and tell her of it.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">
	Several persons cross the stage.

  <li class="number">If not a present remedy, at least a patient sufferance.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="D. JOHN.">
  <li class="number">I wonder that thou (being, as thou say’st thou art, born under Saturn) goest about to apply a moral medicine to a mortifying mischief. I cannot hide what I am: I must be sad when I have cause, and smile at no man’s jests; eat when I have stomach, and wait for no man’s leisure; sleep when I am drowsy, and tend on no man’s business; laugh when I am merry, and claw no man in his humor.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CON.">
  <li class="number">Yea, but you must not make the full show of this till you may do it without controlment. You have of late stood out against your brother, and he hath ta’en you newly into his grace, where it is impossible you should take true root but by the fair weather that you make yourself. It is needful that you frame the season for your own harvest.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="D. JOHN.">
  <li class="number">I had rather be a canker in a hedge than a rose in his grace, and it better fits my blood to be disdain’d of all than to fashion a carriage to rob love from any. In this (though I cannot be said to be a flattering honest man) it must not be denied but I am a plain-dealing villain. I am trusted with a muzzle, and enfranchis’d with a clog, therefore I have decreed not to sing in my cage. If I had my mouth, I would bite; if I had my liberty, I would do my liking. In the mean time let me be that I am, and seek not to alter me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CON.">
  <li class="number">Can you make no use of your discontent?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="D. JOHN.">

</li>
  <li class="number">What news, Borachio?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BORA.">
  <li class="number">I came yonder from a great supper. The Prince your brother is royally entertain’d by Leonato, and I can give you intelligence of an intended marriage.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="D. JOHN.">
  <li class="number">Will it serve for any model to build mischief on? What is he for a fool that betroths himself to unquietness?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BORA.">
  <li class="number">Marry, it is your brother’s right hand.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="D. JOHN.">
  <li class="number">Who, the most exquisite Claudio?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BORA.">
  <li class="number">Even he.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="D. JOHN.">
  <li class="number">A proper squire! And who, and who? Which way looks he?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BORA.">
  <li class="number">Marry, one Hero, the daughter and heir of Leonato.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="D. JOHN.">
  <li class="number">A very forward March-chick! How came you to this?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BORA.">
  <li class="number">Being entertain’d for a perfumer, as I was smoking a musty room, comes me the Prince and Claudio, hand in hand in sad conference. I whipt me behind the arras, and there heard it agreed upon that the Prince should woo Hero for himself, and having obtain’d her, give her to Count Claudio.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="D. JOHN.">
  <li class="number">Come, come, let us thither, this may prove food to my displeasure. That young start-up hath all the glory of my overthrow. If I can cross him any way, I bless myself every way. You are both sure, and will assist me?</li>

<ol data-speaker="BEAT.">
  <li class="number">How tartly that gentleman looks! I never can see him but I am heart-burn’d an hour after.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HERO.">
  <li class="number">He is of a very melancholy disposition.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BEAT.">
  <li class="number">He were an excellent man that were made just in the midway between him and Benedick: the one is too like an image and says nothing, and the other too like my lady’s eldest son, evermore tattling.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEON.">
  <li class="number">Then half <foreign xml:lang="it">Signior</foreign> Benedick’s tongue in Count John’s mouth, and half Count John’s melancholy in <foreign xml:lang="it">Signior</foreign> Benedick’s face—</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BEAT.">
  <li class="number">With a good leg and a good foot, uncle, and money enough in his purse, such a man would win any woman in the world, if ’a could get her good will.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEON.">
  <li class="number">By my troth, niece, thou wilt never get thee a husband, if thou be so shrewd of thy tongue.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANT.">
  <li class="number">In faith, she’s too curst.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BEAT.">
  <li class="number">Too curst is more than curst. I shall lessen God’s sending that way, for it is said, “God sends a curst cow short horns”—but to a cow too curst he sends none.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEON.">
  <li class="number">So, by being too curst, God will send you no horns.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BEAT.">
  <li class="number">Just, if he send me no husband, for the which blessing I am at him upon my knees every morning and evening. Lord, I could not endure a husband with a beard on his face, I had rather lie in the woollen!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEON.">
  <li class="number">You may light on a husband that hath no beard.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BEAT.">
  <li class="number">What should I do with him? Dress him in my apparel and make him my waiting-gentlewoman? He that hath a beard is more than a youth, and he that hath no beard is less than a man; and he that is more than a youth is not for me, and he that is less than a man, I am not for him; therefore I will even take sixpence in earnest of the berrord, and lead his apes into hell.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEON.">
  <li class="number">Well then, go you into hell.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BEAT.">
  <li class="number">No, but to the gate, and there will the devil meet me like an old cuckold with horns on his head, and say, “Get you to heaven, Beatrice, get you to heaven, here’s no place for you maids.” So deliver I up my apes, and away to Saint Peter. For the heavens, he shows me where the bachelors sit, and there live we as merry as the day is long.</li>

  <li class="number">Well, niece, I trust you will be rul’d by your father.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BEAT.">
  <li class="number">Yes, faith, it is my cousin’s duty to make cur’sy and say, “Father, as it please you.” But yet for all that, cousin, let him be a handsome fellow, or else make another cur’sy and say, “Father, as it please me.”</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEON.">
  <li class="number">Well, niece, I hope to see you one day fitted with a husband.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BEAT.">
  <li class="number">Not till God make men of some other mettle than earth. Would it not grieve a woman to be overmaster’d with a piece of valiant dust? To make an account of her life to a clod of wayward marl? No, uncle, I’ll none. Adam’s sons are my brethren, and truly I hold it a sin to match in my kindred.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEON.">
  <li class="number">Daughter, remember what I told you. If the Prince do solicit you in that kind, you know your answer.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BEAT.">
  <li class="number">The fault will be in the music, cousin, if you be not woo’d in good time. If the Prince be too important, tell him there is measure in every thing, and so dance out the answer. For hear me, Hero: wooing, wedding, and repenting, is as a Scotch jig, a measure, and a cinquepace; the first suit is hot and hasty, like a Scotch jig, and full as fantastical; the wedding, mannerly-modest, as a measure, full of state and ancientry; and then comes repentance, and with his bad legs falls into the cinquepace faster and faster, till he sink into his grave.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEON.">
  <li class="number">Cousin, you apprehend passing shrewdly.</li>
</ol>

She told me, not thinking I had been myself, that I was the Prince’s jester, that I was duller than a great thaw, huddling jest upon jest with such impossible conveyance upon me that I stood like a man at a mark, with a whole army shooting at me. She speaks poniards, and every word stabs. If her breath were as terrible as her terminations, there were no living near her, she would infect to the north star. I would not marry her, though she were endow’d with all that Adam had left him before he transgress’d. She would have made Hercules have turn’d spit, yea, and have cleft his club to make the fire too. Come, talk not of her; you shall find her the infernal Ate in good apparel. I would to God some scholar would conjure her, for certainly, while she is here, a man may live as quiet in hell as in a sanctuary, and people sin upon purpose, because they would go thither; so indeed all disquiet, horror, and perturbation follows her.</li>

<ol data-speaker="D. JOHN.">
  <li class="number">Show me briefly how.</li>

<ol data-speaker="BORA.">
  <li class="number">I think I told your lordship a year since, how much I am in the favor of Margaret, the waiting-gentlewoman to Hero.</li>

They will scarcely believe this without trial. Offer them instances, which shall bear no less likelihood than to see me at her chamber-window, hear me call Margaret Hero, hear Margaret term me Claudio; and bring them to see this the very night, before the intended wedding—for in the mean time I will so fashion the matter that Hero shall be absent—and there shall appear such seeming truth of Hero’s disloyalty, that jealousy shall be call’d assurance, and all the preparation overthrown.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="D. JOHN.">

I have known when there was no music with him but the drum and the fife, and now had he rather hear the tabor and the pipe; I have known when he would have walk’d ten mile afoot to see a good armor, and now will he lie ten nights awake carving the fashion of a new doublet; he was wont to speak plain and to the purpose (like an honest man and a soldier), and now is he turn’d orthography—his words are a very fantastical banquet, just so many strange dishes. May I be so converted and see with these eyes? I cannot tell; I think not. I will not be sworn but love may transform me to an oyster, but I’ll take my oath on it, till he have made an oyster of me, he shall never make me such a fool. One woman is fair, yet I am well; another is wise, yet I am well; another virtuous, yet I am well; but till all graces be in one woman, one woman shall not come in my grace. Rich she shall be, that’s certain; wise, or I’ll none; virtuous, or I’ll never cheapen her; fair, or I’ll never look on her; mild, or come not near me; noble, or not I for an angel; of good discourse, an excellent musician, and her hair shall be of what color it please God.

<ol data-speaker="CLAUD.">
  <li class="number">’Tis true indeed, so your daughter says. “Shall I,” says she, “that have so oft encount’red him with scorn, write to him that I love him?”</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEON.">
  <li class="number">This says she now when she is beginning to write to him, for she’ll be up twenty times a night, and there will she sit in her smock till she have writ a sheet of paper. My daughter tells us all.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLAUD.">
  <li class="number">Now you talk of a sheet of paper, I remember a pretty jest your daughter told us of.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEON.">
  <li class="number">O, when she had writ it, and was reading it over, she found “Benedick” and “Beatrice” between the sheet?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLAUD.">
  <li class="number">That.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEON.">
  <li class="number">O, she tore the letter into a thousand half-pence; rail’d at herself, that she should be so immodest to write to one that she knew would flout her. “I measure him,” says she, “by my own spirit, for I should flout him, if he writ to me, yea, though I love him, I should.”</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLAUD.">
  <li class="number">Then down upon her knees she falls, weeps, sobs, beats her heart, tears her hair, prays, curses: “O sweet Benedick! God give me patience!”</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEON.">
  <li class="number">She doth indeed, my daughter says so; and the ecstasy hath so much overborne her that my daughter is sometime afeard she will do a desperate outrage to herself. It is very true.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="D. PEDRO.">
  <li class="number">It were good that Benedick knew of it by some other, if she will not discover it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLAUD.">
  <li class="number">To what end? He would make but a sport of it, and torment the poor lady worse.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="D. PEDRO.">
  <li class="number">And he should, it were an alms to hang him. She’s an excellent sweet lady, and (out of all suspicion) she is virtuous.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLAUD.">
  <li class="number">And she is exceeding wise.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="D. PEDRO.">
  <li class="number">In every thing but in loving Benedick.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEON.">
  <li class="number">O my lord, wisdom and blood combating in so tender a body, we have ten proofs to one that blood hath the victory. I am sorry for her, as I have just cause, being her uncle and her guardian.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="D. PEDRO.">
  <li class="number">I would she had bestow’d this dotage on me, I would have daff’d all other respects, and made her half myself. I pray you tell Benedick of it, and hear what ’a will say.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEON.">
  <li class="number">Were it good, think you?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLAUD.">
  <li class="number">Hero thinks surely she will die, for she says she will die if he love her not, and she will die ere she make her love known, and she will die if he woo her, rather than she will bate one breath of her accustom’d crossness.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="D. PEDRO.">
  <li class="number">She doth well. If she should make tender of her love, ’tis very possible he’ll scorn it, for the man (as you know all) hath a contemptible spirit.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLAUD.">
  <li class="number">He is a very proper man.</li>

  <li class="number">Before God, and in my mind, very wise.</li>

<ol data-speaker="D. PEDRO.">
  <li class="number">He doth indeed show some sparks that are like wit.</li>

<ol data-speaker="CLAUD.">
  <li class="number">And I take him to be valiant.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="D. PEDRO.">
  <li class="number">As Hector, I assure you, and in the managing of quarrels you may say he is wise, for either he avoids them with great discretion, or undertakes them with a most Christian-like fear.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEON.">
  <li class="number">If he do fear God, ’a must necessarily keep peace; if he break the peace, he ought to enter into a quarrel with fear and trembling.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="D. PEDRO.">
  <li class="number">And so will he do, for the man doth fear God, howsoever it seems not in him by some large jests he will make. Well, I am sorry for your niece. Shall we go seek Benedick, and tell him of her love?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLAUD.">
  <li class="number">Never tell him, my lord. Let her wear it out with good counsel.</li>

  <li class="number">This can be no trick: the conference was sadly borne; they have the truth of this from Hero; they seem to pity the lady. It seems her affections have their full bent. Love me? Why, it must be requited. I hear how I am censur’d; they say I will bear myself proudly, if I perceive the love come from her; they say too that she will rather die than give any sign of affection. I did never think to marry. I must not seem proud; happy are they that hear their detractions, and can put them to mending. They say the lady is fair; ’tis a truth, I can bear them witness; and virtuous; ’tis so, I cannot reprove it; and wise, but for loving me; by my troth, it is no addition to her wit, nor no great argument of her folly, for I will be horribly in love with her. I may chance have some odd quirks and remnants of wit broken on me, because I have rail’d so long against marriage; but doth not the appetite alter? A man loves the meat in his youth that he cannot endure in his age. Shall quips and sentences and these paper bullets of the brain awe a man from the career of his humor? No, the world must be peopled. When I said I would die a bachelor, I did not think I should live till I were married. Here comes Beatrice. By this day, she’s a fair lady. I do spy some marks of love in her.</li>

  <li class="number">Whisper her ear, and tell her I and Ursley</li>
  <li class="number">Walk in the orchard, and our whole discourse</li>
  <li class="number">Is all of her. Say that thou overheardst us,</li>

  <li class="number">Where honeysuckles, ripened by the sun,</li>
  <li class="number">Forbid the sun to enter, like favorites</li>
  <li class="number">Made proud by princes, that advance their pride</li>
  <li class="number">Against that power that bred it. There will she hide her,</li>

  <li class="number">When I do name him, let it be thy part</li>
  <li class="number">To praise him more than ever man did merit.</li>

</li>
  <li class="number">No, truly, Ursula, she is too disdainful,</li>
  <li class="number">I know her spirits are as coy and wild</li>
  <li class="number">As haggards of the rock.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="URS.">
  <li class="number">But are you sure</li>
  <li class="number">That Benedick loves Beatrice so entirely?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HERO.">
  <li class="number">So says the Prince and my new-trothed lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="URS.">
  <li class="number">And did they bid you tell her of it, madam?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HERO.">
  <li class="number">They did entreat me to acquaint her of it,</li>
  <li class="number">But I persuaded them, if they lov’d Benedick,</li>
  <li class="number">To wish him wrestle with affection,</li>
  <li class="number">And never to let Beatrice know of it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="URS.">
  <li class="number">Why did you so? Doth not the gentleman</li>
  <li class="number">Deserve as full as fortunate a bed</li>
  <li class="number">As ever Beatrice shall couch upon?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HERO.">
  <li class="number">O god of love! I know he doth deserve</li>
  <li class="number">As much as may be yielded to a man;</li>
  <li class="number">But nature never fram’d a woman’s heart</li>
  <li class="number">Of prouder stuff than that of Beatrice.</li>
  <li class="number">Disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes,</li>
  <li class="number">Misprising what they look on, and her wit</li>
  <li class="number">Values itself so highly that to her</li>
  <li class="number">All matter else seems weak. She cannot love,</li>
  <li class="number">Nor take no shape nor project of affection,</li>
  <li class="number">She is so self-endeared.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="URS.">
  <li class="number">Sure I think so,</li>
  <li class="number">And therefore certainly it were not good</li>
  <li class="number">She knew his love, lest she’ll make sport at it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HERO.">
  <li class="number">Why, you speak truth. I never yet saw man,</li>
  <li class="number">How wise, how noble, young, how rarely featur’d,</li>
  <li class="number">But she would spell him backward. If fair-fac’d,</li>
  <li class="number">She would swear the gentleman should be her sister;</li>
  <li class="number">If black, why, Nature, drawing of an antic,</li>
  <li class="number">Made a foul blot; if tall, a lance ill-headed;</li>
  <li class="number">If low, an agot very vildly cut;</li>
  <li class="number">If speaking, why, a vane blown with all winds;</li>
  <li class="number">If silent, why, a block moved with none.</li>
  <li class="number">So turns she every man the wrong side out,</li>
  <li class="number">And never gives to truth and virtue that</li>
  <li class="number">Which simpleness and merit purchaseth.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="URS.">
  <li class="number">Sure, sure, such carping is not commendable.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HERO.">
  <li class="number">No, not to be so odd, and from all fashions,</li>
  <li class="number">As Beatrice is, cannot be commendable.</li>
  <li class="number">But who dare tell her so? If I should speak,</li>
  <li class="number">She would mock me into air; O, she would laugh me</li>
  <li class="number">Out of myself, press me to death with wit.</li>
  <li class="number">Therefore let Benedick, like cover’d fire,</li>
  <li class="number">Consume away in sighs, waste inwardly.</li>
  <li class="number">It were a better death than die with mocks,</li>
  <li class="number">Which is as bad as die with tickling.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="URS.">
  <li class="number">Yet tell her of it, hear what she will say.</li>

<ol data-speaker="HERO.">
  <li class="number">No, rather I will go to Benedick,</li>
  <li class="number">And counsel him to fight against his passion,</li>
  <li class="number">And truly I’ll devise some honest slanders</li>
  <li class="number">To stain my cousin with. One doth not know</li>

<ol data-speaker="D. PEDRO.">
  <li class="number">Nay, that would be as great a soil in the new gloss of your marriage as to show a child his new coat and forbid him to wear it. I will only be bold with Benedick for his company, for from the crown of his head to the sole of his foot, he is all mirth. He hath twice or thrice cut Cupid’s bow-string, and the little hangman dare not shoot at him. He hath a heart as sound as a bell, and his tongue is the clapper, for what his heart thinks, his tongue speaks.</li>

<ol data-speaker="D. PEDRO.">
  <li class="number">There is no appearance of fancy in him, unless it be a fancy that he hath to strange disguises—as to be a Dutchman today, a Frenchman tomorrow, or in the shape of two countries at once, as a German from the waist downward, all slops, and a Spaniard from the hip upward, no doublet. Unless he have a fancy to this foolery, as it appears he hath, he is no fool for fancy, as you would have it appear he is.</li>

  <li class="number">Nay, but his jesting spirit, which is now crept into a lute-string, and now govern’d by stops.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="D. PEDRO.">
  <li class="number">Indeed that tells a heavy tale for him. Conclude, conclude, he is in love.</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DOG.">
  <li class="number">Why then take no note of him, but let him go, and presently call the rest of the watch together, and thank God you are rid of a knave.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="VERG.">
  <li class="number">If he will not stand when he is bidden, he is none of the Prince’s subjects.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DOG.">
  <li class="number">True, and they are to meddle with none but the Prince’s subjects. You shall also make no noise in the streets; for, for the watch to babble and to talk, is most tolerable, and not to be endur’d.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="2. WATCH.">
  <li class="number">We will rather sleep than talk, we know what belongs to a watch.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DOG.">
  <li class="number">Why, you speak like an ancient and most quiet watchman, for I cannot see how sleeping should offend; only have a care that your bills be not stol’n. Well, you are to call at all the alehouses, and bid those that are drunk get them to bed.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="2. WATCH.">
  <li class="number">How if they will not?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DOG.">
  <li class="number">Why then let them alone till they are sober. If they make you not then the better answer, you may say they are not the men you took them for.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="2. WATCH.">
  <li class="number">Well, sir.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DOG.">
  <li class="number">If you meet a thief, you may suspect him, by virtue of your office, to be no true man; and for such kind of men, the less you meddle or make with them, why, the more is for your honesty.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="2. WATCH.">
  <li class="number">If we know him to be a thief, shall we not lay hands on him?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DOG.">
  <li class="number">Truly by your office you may, but I think they that touch pitch will be defil’d. The most peaceable way for you, if you do take a thief, is to let him show himself what he is, and steal out of your company.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="VERG.">
  <li class="number">You have been always call’d a merciful man, partner.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DOG.">
  <li class="number">Truly, I would not hang a dog by my will, much more a man who hath any honesty in him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="VERG.">
  <li class="number">If you hear a child cry in the night, you must call to the nurse and bid her still it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="2. WATCH.">
  <li class="number">How if the nurse be asleep and will not hear us?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DOG.">
  <li class="number">Why then depart in peace, and let the child wake her with crying, for the ewe that will not hear her lamb when it baes will never answer a calf when he bleats.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="VERG.">
  <li class="number">’Tis very true.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DOG.">
  <li class="number">This is the end of the charge: you, constable, are to present the Prince’s own person. If you meet the Prince in the night, you may stay him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="VERG.">
  <li class="number">Nay, by’r lady, that I think ’a cannot.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DOG.">
  <li class="number">Five shillings to one on’t, with any man that knows the statutes, he may stay him; marry, not without the Prince be willing, for indeed the watch ought to offend no man, and it is an offense to stay a man against his will.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="VERG.">
  <li class="number">By’r lady, I think it be so.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DOG.">
  <li class="number">Ha, ah ha! Well, masters, good night. And there be any matter of weight chances, call up me. Keep your fellows’ counsels and your own, and good night. Come, neighbor.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="2. WATCH.">
  <li class="number">Well, masters, we hear our charge. Let us go sit here upon the church-bench till two, and then all to bed.</li>

<ol data-speaker="BORA.">
  <li class="number">Not so neither, but know that I have tonight woo’d Margaret, the Lady Hero’s gentlewoman, by the name of Hero.

  <li class="number">Talk with a ruffian at her chamber-window,</li>

<ol data-speaker="D. JOHN.">

<ol data-speaker="BEAT.">
  <li class="number">No, truly, not, although until last night,</li>

  <li class="number">Confirm’d, confirm’d! O, that is stronger made</li>

  <li class="number">Would the two princes lie, and Claudio lie,</li>
  <li class="number">Who lov’d her so, that speaking of her foulness,</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FRIAR.">
  <li class="number">Hear me a little,</li>
  <li class="number">For I have only been silent so long,</li>
  <li class="number">And given way unto this course of fortune,</li>
  <li class="number">By noting of the lady. I have mark’d</li>
  <li class="number">A thousand blushing apparitions</li>
  <li class="number">To start into her face, a thousand innocent shames</li>
  <li class="number">In angel whiteness beat away those blushes,</li>
  <li class="number">And in her eye there hath appear’d a fire</li>
  <li class="number">To burn the errors that these princes hold</li>
  <li class="number">Against her maiden truth. Call me a fool,</li>
  <li class="number">Trust not my reading, nor my observations,</li>
  <li class="number">Which with experimental seal doth warrant</li>
  <li class="number">The tenure of my book; trust not my age,</li>

<ol data-speaker="LEON.">
  <li class="number">Friar, it cannot be.</li>
  <li class="number">Thou seest that all the grace that she hath left</li>
  <li class="number">Is that she will not add to her damnation</li>
  <li class="number">A sin of perjury; she not denies it.</li>
  <li class="number">Why seek’st thou then to cover with excuse</li>
  <li class="number">That which appears in proper nakedness?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FRIAR.">

<ol data-speaker="HERO.">
  <li class="number">They know that do accuse me, I know none.</li>
  <li class="number">If I know more of any man alive</li>

  <li class="number">Let all my sins lack mercy! O my father,</li>
  <li class="number">Prove you that any man with me convers’d</li>
  <li class="number">At hours unmeet, or that I yesternight</li>
  <li class="number">Maintain’d the change of words with any creature,</li>
  <li class="number">Refuse me, hate me, torture me to death!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FRIAR.">
  <li class="number">There is some strange misprision in the princes.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BENE.">
  <li class="number">Two of them have the very bent of honor,</li>
  <li class="number">And if their wisdoms be misled in this,</li>
  <li class="number">The practice of it lives in John the Bastard,</li>
  <li class="number">Whose spirits toil in frame of villainies.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEON.">
  <li class="number">I know not. If they speak but truth of her,</li>
  <li class="number">These hands shall tear her; if they wrong her honor,</li>
  <li class="number">The proudest of them shall well hear of it.</li>
  <li class="number">Time hath not yet so dried this blood of mine,</li>
  <li class="number">Nor age so eat up my invention,</li>
  <li class="number">Nor fortune made such havoc of my means,</li>
  <li class="number">Nor my bad life reft me so much of friends,</li>
  <li class="number">But they shall find, awak’d in such a kind,</li>
  <li class="number">Both strength of limb, and policy of mind,</li>
  <li class="number">Ability in means, and choice of friends,</li>
  <li class="number">To quit me of them throughly.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FRIAR.">
  <li class="number">Pause awhile,</li>
  <li class="number">And let my counsel sway you in this case.</li>
  <li class="number">Your daughter here the princes left for dead,</li>
  <li class="number">Let her awhile be secretly kept in,</li>
  <li class="number">And publish it that she is dead indeed.</li>
  <li class="number">Maintain a mourning ostentation,</li>
  <li class="number">And on your family’s old monument</li>
  <li class="number">Hang mournful epitaphs, and do all rites</li>
  <li class="number">That appertain unto a burial.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEON.">
  <li class="number">What shall become of this? What will this do?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FRIAR.">
  <li class="number">Marry, this well carried shall on her behalf</li>
  <li class="number">Change slander to remorse; that is some good.</li>
  <li class="number">But not for that dream I on this strange course,</li>
  <li class="number">But on this travail look for greater birth:</li>
  <li class="number">She dying, as it must be so maintain’d,</li>
  <li class="number">Upon the instant that she was accus’d,</li>
  <li class="number">Shall be lamented, pitied, and excus’d</li>
  <li class="number">Of every hearer; for it so falls out</li>
  <li class="number">That what we have we prize not to the worth</li>
  <li class="number">Whiles we enjoy it, but being lack’d and lost,</li>
  <li class="number">Why then we rack the value; then we find</li>
  <li class="number">The virtue that possession would not show us</li>
  <li class="number">Whiles it was ours. So will it fare with Claudio:</li>
  <li class="number">When he shall hear she died upon his words,</li>
  <li class="number">Th’ idea of her life shall sweetly creep</li>
  <li class="number">Into his study of imagination,</li>
  <li class="number">And every lovely organ of her life</li>
  <li class="number">Shall come apparell’d in more precious habit,</li>
  <li class="number">More moving, delicate, and full of life,</li>
  <li class="number">Into the eye and prospect of his soul,</li>
  <li class="number">Than when she liv’d indeed. Then shall he mourn,</li>
  <li class="number">If ever love had interest in his liver,</li>
  <li class="number">And wish he had not so accused her;</li>
  <li class="number">No, though he thought his accusation true.</li>
  <li class="number">Let this be so, and doubt not but success</li>
  <li class="number">Will fashion the event in better shape</li>
  <li class="number">Than I can lay it down in likelihood.</li>
  <li class="number">But if all aim but this be levell’d false,</li>
  <li class="number">The supposition of the lady’s death</li>
  <li class="number">Will quench the wonder of her infamy.</li>
  <li class="number">And if it sort not well, you may conceal her,</li>
  <li class="number">As best befits her wounded reputation,</li>
  <li class="number">In some reclusive and religious life,</li>
  <li class="number">Out of all eyes, tongues, minds, and injuries.</li>

  <li class="number">But such a one whose wrongs do suit with mine.</li>
  <li class="number">Bring me a father that so lov’d his child,</li>
  <li class="number">Whose joy of her is overwhelm’d like mine,</li>

  <li class="number">Measure his woe the length and breadth of mine,</li>
  <li class="number">And let it answer every strain for strain,</li>
  <li class="number">As thus for thus, and such a grief for such,</li>
  <li class="number">In every lineament, branch, shape, and form;</li>
  <li class="number">If such a one will smile and stroke his beard,</li>

  <li class="number">Their counsel turns to passion, which before</li>
  <li class="number">Would give preceptial med’cine to rage,</li>
  <li class="number">Fetter strong madness in a silken thread,</li>
  <li class="number">Charm ache with air, and agony with words.</li>
  <li class="number">No, no, ’tis all men’s office to speak patience</li>
  <li class="number">To those that wring under the load of sorrow,</li>
  <li class="number">But no man’s virtue nor sufficiency</li>
  <li class="number">To be so moral when he shall endure</li>

I said thou hadst a fine wit.
 “True,” said she, “a fine little one.” “No,” said I, “a great wit.” “Right,” says she,
 “a great gross one.” “Nay,” said I, “a good wit.” “Just,” said she, “it hurts nobody.”
 “Nay,” said I, “the gentleman is wise.” “Certain,” said she, “a wise gentleman.” “Nay,” 
said I, “he hath the tongues.” “That I believe,” said she, “for he swore a thing to me on Monday night, which he forswore on Tuesday morning. 
There’s a double tongue, there’s two tongues.” 
Thus did she an hour together trans-shape thy particular virtues, yet at last she concluded with a sigh, thou wast the proper’st man in Italy.</li>

  <li class="number">All, all, and, moreover, God saw him when he was hid in the garden.</li>

<ol data-speaker="BENE.">
  <li class="number">Fare you well, boy, you know my mind. I will leave you now to your gossip-like humor. You break jests as braggarts do their blades, which, God be thank’d, hurt not. My lord, for your many courtesies I thank you. I must discontinue your company. Your brother the bastard is fled from Messina. You have among you kill’d a sweet and innocent lady.

Marry, I cannot show it in rhyme; I have tried. I can find out no rhyme to “lady” but “baby,” an innocent rhyme; for “scorn,” “horn,” a hard rhyme; for “school,” “fool,” a babbling rhyme: very ominous endings. No, I was not born under a rhyming planet, nor I cannot woo in festival terms.</li>

<ol data-speaker="BENE.">
  <li class="number">They swore that you were almost sick for me.</li>

  <li class="number">I’ll tell thee what, Prince: a college of wit-crackers cannot flout me out of my humor. Dost thou think I care for a satire or an epigram? No, if a man will be beaten with brains, ’a shall wear nothing handsome about him. In brief, since I do purpose to marry, I will think nothing to any purpose that the world can say against it, and therefore never flout at me for what I have said against it; for man is a giddy thing, and this is my conclusion. 
For thy part, Claudio, I did think to have beaten thee, but in that thou art like to be my kinsman, live unbruis’d, and love my cousin.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLAUD.">
  <li class="number">I had well hop’d thou wouldst have denied Beatrice, that I might have cudgell’d thee out of thy single life, to make thee a double-dealer, which out of question thou wilt be, if my cousin do not look exceeding narrowly to thee.</li>
