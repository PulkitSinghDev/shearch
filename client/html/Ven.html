<h1>Venus & Adonis</h1>

  <ol>
    <li>Vilia miretur vulgus: mihi flauus Apollo</li>
    <li>Pocula Castalia plena ministret aqua.</li>
    <li>To the Right Honorable Henry Wriothesley,</li>
    <li>Earl of Southampton, and Baron of Titchfield.</li>
    <li class="number">Right Honorable, I know not how I shall offend in dedicating my unpolished lines to your Lordship, nor how the world will censor me for choosing so strong a prop to support so weak a burden, only if your Honor seem but pleased, I account myself highly praised, and vow to take advantage of all idle hours, until I have honored you with some graver labor. But if the first heir of my invention prove deformed, I shall be sorry it had so noble a godfather: and neverafter hear so barren a land, for fear it yield me still so bad a harvest. I leave it to your honorable survey, and your honor to your hearts content, which I wish may always answer your own wish, and the world's hopeful expectation.</li>
    <li>Your honors in all duty,</li>
    <li>Even as the sun with purple-color’d face</li>
    <li>Had ta’en his last leave of the weeping morn,</li>
    <li>Rose-cheek’d Adonis hied him to the chase;</li>
    <li class="number">Hunting he lov’d, but love he laugh’d to scorn.</li>
    <li>Sick-thoughted Venus makes amain unto him,</li>
    <li>And like a bold-fac’d suitor gins to woo him.</li>
    <li>“Thrice fairer than myself,” thus she began,</li>
    <li>“The field’s chief flower, sweet above compare,</li>
    <li class="number">Stain to all nymphs, more lovely than a man,</li>
    <li>More white and red than doves or roses are,</li>
    <li>Nature, that made thee with herself at strife,</li>
    <li>Saith that the world hath ending with thy life.</li>
    <li>Vouchsafe, thou wonder, to alight thy steed,</li>
    <li class="number">And rein his proud head to the saddle-bow;</li>
    <li>If thou wilt deign this favor, for thy meed</li>
    <li>A thousand honey secrets shalt thou know.</li>
    <li>Here come and sit, where never serpent hisses,</li>
    <li>And being set, I’ll smother thee with kisses;</li>
    <li class="number">And yet not cloy thy lips with loath’d satiety,</li>
    <li>But rather famish them amid their plenty,</li>
    <li>Making them red, and pale, with fresh variety—</li>
    <li>Ten kisses short as one, one long as twenty.</li>
    <li>A summer’s day will seem an hour but short,</li>
    <li class="number">Being wasted in such time-beguiling sport.”</li>
    <li>With this she seizeth on his sweating palm,</li>
    <li>The president of pith and livelihood,</li>
    <li>And trembling in her passion, calls it balm,</li>
    <li>Earth’s sovereign salve, to do a goddess good.</li>
    <li class="number">Being so enrag’d, desire doth lend her force</li>
    <li>Courageously to pluck him from his horse.</li>
    <li>Over one arm the lusty courser’s rein,</li>
    <li>Under her other was the tender boy,</li>
    <li>Who blush’d, and pouted in a dull disdain,</li>
    <li class="number">With leaden appetite, unapt to toy;</li>
    <li>She red and hot as coals of glowing fire,</li>
    <li>He red for shame, but frosty in desire.</li>
    <li>The studded bridle on a ragged bough</li>
    <li>Nimbly she fastens (O how quick is love!);</li>
    <li class="number">The steed is stalled up, and even now</li>
    <li>To tie the rider she begins to prove.</li>
    <li>Backward she push’d him, as she would be thrust,</li>
    <li>And govern’d him in strength, though not in lust.</li>
    <li>So soon was she along as he was down,</li>
    <li class="number">Each leaning on their elbows and their hips.</li>
    <li>Now doth she stroke his cheek, now doth he frown,</li>
    <li>And gins to chide, but soon she stops his lips,</li>
    <li>And kissing speaks, with lustful language broken,</li>
    <li>“If thou wilt chide, thy lips shall never open.”</li>
    <li class="number">He burns with bashful shame, she with her tears</li>
    <li>Doth quench the maiden burning of his cheeks;</li>
    <li>Then with her windy sighs and golden hairs</li>
    <li>To fan and blow them dry again she seeks.</li>
    <li>He saith she is immodest, blames her miss;</li>
    <li class="number">What follows more, she murders with a kiss.</li>
    <li>Even as an empty eagle, sharp by fast,</li>
    <li>Tires with her beak on feathers, flesh, and bone,</li>
    <li>Shaking her wings, devouring all in haste,</li>
    <li>Till either gorge be stuff’d, or prey be gone;</li>
    <li class="number">Even so she kiss’d his brow, his cheek, his chin,</li>
    <li>And where she ends, she doth anew begin.</li>
    <li>Forc’d to content, but never to obey,</li>
    <li>Panting he lies, and breatheth in her face.</li>
    <li>She feedeth on the steam, as on a prey,</li>
    <li class="number">And calls it heavenly moisture, air of grace,</li>
    <li>Wishing her cheeks were gardens full of flowers,</li>
    <li>So they were dew’d with such distilling showers.</li>
    <li>Look how a bird lies tangled in a net,</li>
    <li>So fast’ned in her arms Adonis lies;</li>
    <li class="number">Pure shame and aw’d resistance made him fret,</li>
    <li>Which bred more beauty in his angry eyes.</li>
    <li>Rain added to a river that is rank</li>
    <li>Perforce will force it overflow the bank.</li>
    <li>Still she entreats, and prettily entreats,</li>
    <li class="number">For to a pretty ear she tunes her tale.</li>
    <li>Still is he sullen, still he low’rs and frets,</li>
    <li>’Twixt crimson shame and anger ashy-pale.</li>
    <li>Being red, she loves him best, and being white,</li>
    <li>Her best is better’d with a more delight.</li>
    <li class="number">Look how he can, she cannot choose but love,</li>
    <li>And by her fair immortal hand she swears</li>
    <li>From his soft bosom never to remove</li>
    <li>Till he take truce with her contending tears,</li>
    <li>Which long have rain’d, making her cheeks all wet,</li>
    <li class="number">And one sweet kiss shall pay this comptless debt.</li>
    <li>Upon this promise did he raise his chin,</li>
    <li>Like a dive-dapper peering through a wave,</li>
    <li>Who being look’d on, ducks as quickly in;</li>
    <li>So offers he to give what she did crave,</li>
    <li class="number">But when her lips were ready for his pay,</li>
    <li>He winks, and turns his lips another way.</li>
    <li>Never did passenger in summer’s heat</li>
    <li>More thirst for drink than she for this good turn.</li>
    <li>Her help she sees, but help she cannot get,</li>
    <li class="number">She bathes in water, yet her fire must burn.</li>
    <li>“O, pity,” gan she cry, “flint-hearted boy,</li>
    <li>’Tis but a kiss I beg, why art thou coy?</li>
    <li>I have been wooed, as I entreat thee now,</li>
    <li>Even by the stern and direful god of war,</li>
    <li class="number">Whose sinewy neck in battle ne’er did bow,</li>
    <li>Who conquers where he comes in every jar,</li>
    <li>Yet hath he been my captive, and my slave,</li>
    <li>And begg’d for that which thou unask’d shalt have.</li>
    <li>Over my altars hath he hung his lance,</li>
    <li class="number">His batt’red shield, his uncontrolled crest,</li>
    <li>And for my sake hath learn’d to sport and dance,</li>
    <li>To toy, to wanton, dally, smile, and jest,</li>
    <li>Scorning his churlish drum, and ensign red,</li>
    <li>Making my arms his field, his tent my bed.</li>
    <li class="number">Thus he that overrul’d I overswayed,</li>
    <li>Leading him prisoner in a red rose chain;</li>
    <li>Strong-temper’d steel his stronger strength obeyed,</li>
    <li>Yet was he servile to my coy disdain.</li>
    <li>O, be not proud, nor brag not of thy might,</li>
    <li class="number">For mast’ring her that foil’d the god of fight.</li>
    <li>Touch but my lips with those fair lips of thine—</li>
    <li>Though mine be not so fair, yet are they red—</li>
    <li>The kiss shall be thine own as well as mine.</li>
    <li>What seest thou in the ground? Hold up thy head,</li>
    <li class="number">Look in mine eyeballs, there thy beauty lies;</li>
    <li>Then why not lips on lips, since eyes in eyes?</li>
    <li>Art thou asham’d to kiss? Then wink again,</li>
    <li>And I will wink, so shall the day seem night.</li>
    <li>Love keeps his revels where there are but twain;</li>
    <li class="number">Be bold to play, our sport is not in sight;</li>
    <li>These blue-vein’d violets whereon we lean</li>
    <li>Never can blab, nor know not what we mean.</li>
    <li>The tender spring upon thy tempting lip</li>
    <li>Shows thee unripe; yet mayst thou well be tasted.</li>
    <li class="number">Make use of time, let not advantage slip,</li>
    <li>Beauty within itself should not be wasted.</li>
    <li>Fair flowers that are not gath’red in their prime</li>
    <li>Rot, and consume themselves in little time.</li>
    <li>Were I hard-favor’d, foul, or wrinkled old,</li>
    <li class="number">Ill-nurtur’d, crooked, churlish, harsh in voice,</li>
    <li>O’erworn, despised, rheumatic, and cold,</li>
    <li>Thick-sighted, barren, lean, and lacking juice,</li>
    <li>Then mightst thou pause, for then I were not for thee,</li>
    <li>But having no defects, why dost abhor me?</li>
    <li class="number">Thou canst not see one wrinkle in my brow,</li>
    <li>Mine eyes are grey, and bright, and quick in turning;</li>
    <li>My beauty as the spring doth yearly grow,</li>
    <li>My flesh is soft and plump, my marrow burning,</li>
    <li>My smooth moist hand, were it with thy hand felt,</li>
    <li class="number">Would in thy palm dissolve, or seem to melt.</li>
    <li>Bid me discourse, I will enchant thine ear,</li>
    <li>Or like a fairy, trip upon the green,</li>
    <li>Or like a nymph, with long disheveled hair,</li>
    <li>Dance on the sands, and yet no footing seen.</li>
    <li class="number">Love is a spirit all compact of fire,</li>
    <li>Not gross to sink, but light, and will aspire.</li>
    <li>Witness this primrose bank whereon I lie,</li>
    <li>These forceless flowers like sturdy trees support me;</li>
    <li>Two strengthless doves will draw me through the sky,</li>
    <li class="number">From morn till night, even where I list to sport me.</li>
    <li>Is love so light, sweet boy, and may it be</li>
    <li>That thou should think it heavy unto thee?</li>
    <li>Is thine own heart to thine own face affected?</li>
    <li>Can thy right hand seize love upon thy left?</li>
    <li class="number">Then woo thyself, be of thyself rejected;</li>
    <li>Steal thine own freedom, and complain on theft.</li>
    <li>Narcissus so himself himself forsook,</li>
    <li>And died to kiss his shadow in the brook.</li>
    <li>Torches are made to light, jewels to wear,</li>
    <li class="number">Dainties to taste, fresh beauty for the use,</li>
    <li>Herbs for their smell, and sappy plants to bear:</li>
    <li>Things growing to themselves are growth’s abuse.</li>
    <li>Seeds spring from seeds, and beauty breedeth beauty;</li>
    <li>Thou wast begot, to get it is thy duty.</li>
    <li class="number">Upon the earth’s increase why shouldst thou feed,</li>
    <li>Unless the earth with thy increase be fed?</li>
    <li>By law of nature thou art bound to breed,</li>
    <li>That thine may live, when thou thyself art dead;</li>
    <li>And so in spite of death thou dost survive,</li>
    <li class="number">In that thy likeness still is left alive.”</li>
    <li>By this the love-sick queen began to sweat,</li>
    <li>For where they lay the shadow had forsook them,</li>
    <li>And Titan, tired in the midday heat,</li>
    <li>With burning eye did hotly overlook them,</li>
    <li class="number">Wishing Adonis had his team to guide,</li>
    <li>So he were like him, and by Venus’ side.</li>
    <li>And now Adonis, with a lazy sprite,</li>
    <li>And with a heavy, dark, disliking eye,</li>
    <li>His low’ring brows o’erwhelming his fair sight,</li>
    <li class="number">Like misty vapors when they blot the sky,</li>
    <li>Souring his cheeks, cries, “Fie, no more of love!</li>
    <li>The sun doth burn my face, I must remove.”</li>
    <li>“Ay me,” quoth Venus, “young, and so unkind,</li>
    <li>What bare excuses mak’st thou to be gone!</li>
    <li class="number">I’ll sigh celestial breath, whose gentle wind</li>
    <li>Shall cool the heat of this descending sun;</li>
    <li>I’ll make a shadow for thee of my hairs;</li>
    <li>If they burn too, I’ll quench them with my tears.</li>
    <li>The sun that shines from heaven shines but warm,</li>
    <li class="number">And lo I lie between that sun and thee;</li>
    <li>The heat I have from thence doth little harm,</li>
    <li>Thine eye darts forth the fire that burneth me,</li>
    <li>And were I not immortal, life were done,</li>
    <li>Between this heavenly and earthly sun.</li>
    <li class="number">Art thou obdurate, flinty, hard as steel?</li>
    <li>Nay, more than flint, for stone at rain relenteth.</li>
    <li>Art thou a woman’s son and canst not feel</li>
    <li>What ’tis to love, how want of love tormenteth?</li>
    <li>O, had thy mother borne so hard a mind,</li>
    <li class="number">She had not brought forth thee, but died unkind.</li>
    <li>What am I that thou shouldst contemn me this?</li>
    <li>Or what great danger dwells upon my suit?</li>
    <li>What were thy lips the worse for one poor kiss?</li>
    <li>Speak, fair, but speak fair words, or else be mute.</li>
    <li class="number">Give me one kiss, I’ll give it thee again,</li>
    <li>And one for int’rest, if thou wilt have twain.</li>
    <li>Fie, lifeless picture, cold and senseless stone,</li>
    <li>Well-painted idol, image dull and dead,</li>
    <li>Statue contenting but the eye alone,</li>
    <li class="number">Thing like a man, but of no woman bred!</li>
    <li>Thou art no man, though of a man’s complexion,</li>
    <li>For men will kiss even by their own direction.”</li>
    <li>This said, impatience chokes her pleading tongue,</li>
    <li>And swelling passion doth provoke a pause.</li>
    <li class="number">Red cheeks and fiery eyes blaze forth her wrong;</li>
    <li>Being judge in love, she cannot right her cause.</li>
    <li>And now she weeps, and now she fain would speak,</li>
    <li>And now her sobs do her intendments break.</li>
    <li>Sometime she shakes her head, and then his hand,</li>
    <li class="number">Now gazeth she on him, now on the ground;</li>
    <li>Sometime her arms infold him like a band:</li>
    <li>She would, he will not in her arms be bound;</li>
    <li>And when from thence he struggles to be gone,</li>
    <li>She locks her lily fingers one in one.</li>
    <li class="number">“Fondling,” she saith, “since I have hemm’d thee here</li>
    <li>Within the circuit of this ivory pale,</li>
    <li>I’ll be a park, and thou shalt be my deer:</li>
    <li>Feed where thou wilt, on mountain, or in dale;</li>
    <li>Graze on my lips, and if those hills be dry,</li>
    <li class="number">Stray lower, where the pleasant fountains lie.</li>
    <li>Within this limit is relief enough,</li>
    <li>Sweet bottom grass and high delightful plain,</li>
    <li>Round rising hillocks, brakes obscure and rough,</li>
    <li>To shelter thee from tempest and from rain;</li>
    <li class="number">Then be my deer, since I am such a park,</li>
    <li>No dog shall rouse thee, though a thousand bark.”</li>
    <li>At this Adonis smiles as in disdain,</li>
    <li>That in each cheek appears a pretty dimple;</li>
    <li>Love made those hollows, if himself were slain,</li>
    <li class="number">He might be buried in a tomb so simple,</li>
    <li>Foreknowing well, if there he came to lie,</li>
    <li>Why, there Love liv’d, and there he could not die.</li>
    <li>These lovely caves, these round enchanting pits,</li>
    <li>Open’d their mouths to swallow Venus’ liking.</li>
    <li class="number">Being mad before, how doth she now for wits?</li>
    <li>Struck dead at first, what needs a second striking?</li>
    <li>Poor queen of love, in thine own law forlorn,</li>
    <li>To love a cheek that smiles at thee in scorn!</li>
    <li>Now which way shall she turn? What shall she say?</li>
    <li class="number">Her words are done, her woes the more increasing;</li>
    <li>The time is spent, her object will away,</li>
    <li>And from her twining arms doth urge releasing.</li>
    <li>“Pity,” she cries, “some favor, some remorse!”</li>
    <li>Away he springs, and hasteth to his horse.</li>
    <li class="number">But lo from forth a copse that neighbors by,</li>
    <li>A breeding jennet, lusty, young, and proud,</li>
    <li>Adonis’ trampling courser doth espy;</li>
    <li>And forth she rushes, snorts, and neighs aloud.</li>
    <li>The strong-neck’d steed, being tied unto a tree,</li>
    <li class="number">Breaketh his rein, and to her straight goes he.</li>
    <li>Imperiously he leaps, he neighs, he bounds,</li>
    <li>And now his woven girths he breaks asunder;</li>
    <li>The bearing earth with his hard hoof he wounds,</li>
    <li>Whose hollow womb resounds like heaven’s thunder;</li>
    <li class="number">The iron bit he crusheth ’tween his teeth,</li>
    <li>Controlling what he was controlled with.</li>
    <li>His ears up-prick’d, his braided hanging mane</li>
    <li>Upon his compass’d crest now stand on end,</li>
    <li>His nostrils drink the air, and forth again</li>
    <li class="number">As from a furnace, vapors doth he send;</li>
    <li>His eye, which scornfully glisters like fire,</li>
    <li>Shows his hot courage and his high desire.</li>
    <li>Sometime he trots, as if he told the steps,</li>
    <li>With gentle majesty and modest pride;</li>
    <li class="number">Anon he rears upright, curvets, and leaps,</li>
    <li>As who should say, “Lo thus my strength is tried;</li>
    <li>And this I do to captivate the eye</li>
    <li>Of the fair breeder that is standing by.”</li>
    <li>What recketh he his rider’s angry stir,</li>
    <li class="number">His flattering “Holla,” or his “Stand, I say”?</li>
    <li>What cares he now for curb, or pricking spur,</li>
    <li>For rich caparisons, or trappings gay?</li>
    <li>He sees his love, and nothing else he sees,</li>
    <li>For nothing else with his proud sight agrees.</li>
    <li class="number">Look when a painter would surpass the life</li>
    <li>In limning out a well-proportioned steed,</li>
    <li>His art with nature’s workmanship at strife,</li>
    <li>As if the dead the living should exceed;</li>
    <li>So did this horse excel a common one,</li>
    <li class="number">In shape, in courage, color, pace, and bone.</li>
    <li>Round-hoof’d, short-jointed, fetlocks shag and long,</li>
    <li>Broad breast, full eye, small head, and nostril wide,</li>
    <li>High crest, short ears, straight legs and passing strong,</li>
    <li>Thin mane, thick tail, broad buttock, tender hide:</li>
    <li class="number">Look what a horse should have he did not lack,</li>
    <li>Save a proud rider on so proud a back.</li>
    <li>Sometime he scuds far off, and there he stares,</li>
    <li>Anon he starts at stirring of a feather;</li>
    <li>To bid the wind a base he now prepares,</li>
    <li class="number">And whe’er he run, or fly, they know not whether;</li>
    <li>For through his mane and tail the high wind sings,</li>
    <li>Fanning the hairs, who wave like feath’red wings.</li>
    <li>He looks upon his love, and neighs unto her,</li>
    <li>She answers him, as if she knew his mind;</li>
    <li class="number">Being proud as females are, to see him woo her,</li>
    <li>She puts on outward strangeness, seems unkind,</li>
    <li>Spurns at his love, and scorns the heat he feels,</li>
    <li>Beating his kind embracements with her heels.</li>
    <li>Then like a melancholy malcontent,</li>
    <li class="number">He vails his tail that like a falling plume</li>
    <li>Cool shadow to his melting buttock lent;</li>
    <li>He stamps, and bites the poor flies in his fume.</li>
    <li>His love, perceiving how he was enrag’d,</li>
    <li>Grew kinder, and his fury was assuag’d.</li>
    <li class="number">His testy master goeth about to take him,</li>
    <li>When lo the unback’d breeder, full of fear,</li>
    <li>Jealous of catching, swiftly doth forsake him,</li>
    <li>With her the horse, and left Adonis there.</li>
    <li>As they were mad unto the wood they hie them,</li>
    <li class="number">Outstripping crows that strive to overfly them.</li>
    <li>All swoll’n with chafing, down Adonis sits,</li>
    <li>Banning his boist’rous and unruly beast;</li>
    <li>And now the happy season once more fits</li>
    <li>That love-sick Love by pleading may be blest;</li>
    <li class="number">For lovers say, the heart hath treble wrong</li>
    <li>When it is barr’d the aidance of the tongue.</li>
    <li>An oven that is stopp’d, or river stay’d,</li>
    <li>Burneth more hotly, swelleth with more rage;</li>
    <li>So of concealed sorrow may be said,</li>
    <li class="number">Free vent of words love’s fire doth assuage,</li>
    <li>But when the heart’s attorney once is mute,</li>
    <li>The client breaks, as desperate in his suit.</li>
    <li>He sees her coming, and begins to glow,</li>
    <li>Even as a dying coal revives with wind,</li>
    <li class="number">And with his bonnet hides his angry brow,</li>
    <li>Looks on the dull earth with disturbed mind,</li>
    <li>Taking no notice that she is so nigh,</li>
    <li>For all askance he holds her in his eye.</li>
    <li>O what a sight it was wistly to view,</li>
    <li class="number">How she came stealing to the wayward boy,</li>
    <li>To note the fighting conflict of her hue,</li>
    <li>How white and red each other did destroy!</li>
    <li>But now her cheek was pale, and by and by</li>
    <li>It flash’d forth fire, as lightning from the sky.</li>
    <li class="number">Now was she just before him as he sat,</li>
    <li>And like a lowly lover down she kneels;</li>
    <li>With one fair hand she heaveth up his hat,</li>
    <li>Her other tender hand his fair cheek feels:</li>
    <li>His tend’rer cheek receives her soft hand’s print,</li>
    <li class="number">As apt as new-fall’n snow takes any dint.</li>
    <li>O what a war of looks was then between them!</li>
    <li>Her eyes petitioners to his eyes suing,</li>
    <li>His eyes saw her eyes as they had not seen them,</li>
    <li>Her eyes wooed still, his eyes disdain’d the wooing;</li>
    <li class="number">And all this dumb play had his acts made plain</li>
    <li>With tears which chorus-like her eyes did rain.</li>
    <li>Full gently now she takes him by the hand,</li>
    <li>A lily prison’d in a jail of snow,</li>
    <li>Or ivory in an alabaster band,</li>
    <li class="number">So white a friend engirts so white a foe:</li>
    <li>This beauteous combat, willful and unwilling,</li>
    <li>Showed like two silver doves that sit a-billing.</li>
    <li>Once more the engine of her thoughts began:</li>
    <li>“O fairest mover on this mortal round,</li>
    <li class="number">Would thou wert as I am, and I a man,</li>
    <li>My heart all whole as thine, thy heart my wound!</li>
    <li>For one sweet look thy help I would assure thee,</li>
    <li>Though nothing but my body’s bane would cure thee.”</li>
    <li>“Give me my hand,” saith he, “why dost thou feel it?”</li>
    <li class="number">“Give me my heart,” saith she, “and thou shalt have it.</li>
    <li>O, give it me, lest thy hard heart do steel it,</li>
    <li>And being steel’d, soft sighs can never grave it.</li>
    <li>Then love’s deep groans I never shall regard,</li>
    <li>Because Adonis’ heart hath made mine hard.”</li>
    <li class="number">“For shame,” he cries, “let go, and let me go,</li>
    <li>My day’s delight is past, my horse is gone,</li>
    <li>And ’tis your fault I am bereft him so.</li>
    <li>I pray you hence, and leave me here alone,</li>
    <li>For all my mind, my thought, my busy care,</li>
    <li class="number">Is how to get my palfrey from the mare.”</li>
    <li>Thus she replies: “Thy palfrey, as he should,</li>
    <li>Welcomes the warm approach of sweet desire;</li>
    <li>Affection is a coal that must be cool’d,</li>
    <li>Else suffer’d it will set the heart on fire.</li>
    <li class="number">The sea hath bounds, but deep desire hath none,</li>
    <li>Therefore no marvel though thy horse be gone.</li>
    <li>How like a jade he stood, tied to the tree,</li>
    <li>Servilely master’d with a leathern rein!</li>
    <li>But when he saw his love, his youth’s fair fee,</li>
    <li class="number">He held such petty bondage in disdain,</li>
    <li>Throwing the base thong from his bending crest,</li>
    <li>Enfranchising his mouth, his back, his breast.</li>
    <li>Who sees his true-love in her naked bed,</li>
    <li>Teaching the sheets a whiter hue than white,</li>
    <li class="number">But when his glutton eye so full hath fed,</li>
    <li>His other agents aim at like delight?</li>
    <li>Who is so faint that dares not be so bold</li>
    <li>To touch the fire, the weather being cold?</li>
    <li>Let me excuse thy courser, gentle boy,</li>
    <li class="number">And learn of him, I heartily beseech thee,</li>
    <li>To take advantage on presented joy;</li>
    <li>Though I were dumb, yet his proceedings teach thee.</li>
    <li>O, learn to love, the lesson is but plain,</li>
    <li>And once made perfect, never lost again.”</li>
    <li class="number">“I know not love,” quoth he, “nor will not know it,</li>
    <li>Unless it be a boar, and then I chase it;</li>
    <li>’Tis much to borrow, and I will not owe it;</li>
    <li>My love to love is love but to disgrace it,</li>
    <li>For I have heard it is a life in death,</li>
    <li class="number">That laughs and weeps, and all but with a breath.</li>
    <li>Who wears a garment shapeless and unfinish’d?</li>
    <li>Who plucks the bud before one leaf put forth?</li>
    <li>If springing things be any jot diminish’d,</li>
    <li>They wither in their prime, prove nothing worth;</li>
    <li class="number">The colt that’s back’d and burden’d being young,</li>
    <li>Loseth his pride, and never waxeth strong.</li>
    <li>You hurt my hand with wringing, let us part,</li>
    <li>And leave this idle theme, this bootless chat;</li>
    <li>Remove your siege from my unyielding heart,</li>
    <li class="number">To love’s alarms it will not ope the gate;</li>
    <li>Dismiss your vows, your feigned tears, your flatt’ry,</li>
    <li>For where a heart is hard they make no batt’ry.”</li>
    <li>“What, canst thou talk?” quoth she, “hast thou a tongue?</li>
    <li>O would thou hadst not, or I had no hearing!</li>
    <li class="number">Thy mermaid’s voice hath done me double wrong;</li>
    <li>I had my load before, now press’d with bearing:</li>
    <li>Melodious discord, heavenly tune harsh sounding,</li>
    <li>Ears’ deep sweet music, and heart’s deep sore wounding.</li>
    <li>Had I no eyes but ears, my ears would love</li>
    <li class="number">That inward beauty and invisible,</li>
    <li>Or were I deaf, thy outward parts would move</li>
    <li>Each part in me that were but sensible;</li>
    <li>Though neither eyes nor ears to hear nor see,</li>
    <li>Yet should I be in love by touching thee.</li>
    <li class="number">Say that the sense of feeling were bereft me,</li>
    <li>And that I could not see, nor hear, nor touch,</li>
    <li>And nothing but the very smell were left me,</li>
    <li>Yet would my love to thee be still as much,</li>
    <li>For from the stillitory of thy face excelling</li>
    <li class="number">Comes breath perfum’d, that breedeth love by smelling.</li>
    <li>But O, what banquet wert thou to the taste,</li>
    <li>Being nurse and feeder of the other four!</li>
    <li>Would they not wish the feast might ever last,</li>
    <li>And bid Suspicion double-lock the door,</li>
    <li class="number">Lest Jealousy, that sour unwelcome guest,</li>
    <li>Should by his stealing in disturb the feast?”</li>
    <li>Once more the ruby-color’d portal open’d,</li>
    <li>Which to his speech did honey passage yield,</li>
    <li>Like a red morn, that ever yet betoken’d</li>
    <li class="number">Wrack to the seaman, tempest to the field,</li>
    <li>Sorrow to shepherds, woe unto the birds,</li>
    <li>Gusts and foul flaws to herdmen and to herds.</li>
    <li>This ill presage advisedly she marketh:</li>
    <li>Even as the wind is hush’d before it raineth,</li>
    <li class="number">Or as the wolf doth grin before he barketh,</li>
    <li>Or as the berry breaks before it staineth,</li>
    <li>Or like the deadly bullet of a gun,</li>
    <li>His meaning struck her ere his words begun.</li>
    <li>And at his look she flatly falleth down,</li>
    <li class="number">For looks kill love, and love by looks reviveth:</li>
    <li>A smile recures the wounding of a frown.</li>
    <li>But blessed bankrupt that by love so thriveth!</li>
    <li>The silly boy, believing she is dead,</li>
    <li>Claps her pale cheek, till clapping makes it red;</li>
    <li class="number">And all amaz’d, brake off his late intent,</li>
    <li>For sharply he did think to reprehend her,</li>
    <li>Which cunning Love did wittily prevent:</li>
    <li>Fair fall the wit that can so well defend her!</li>
    <li>For on the grass she lies as she were slain,</li>
    <li class="number">Till his breath breatheth life in her again.</li>
    <li>He wrings her nose, he strikes her on the cheeks,</li>
    <li>He bends her fingers, holds her pulses hard,</li>
    <li>He chafes her lips, a thousand ways he seeks</li>
    <li>To mend the hurt that his unkindness marr’d,</li>
    <li class="number">He kisses her, and she by her good will</li>
    <li>Will never rise, so he will kiss her still.</li>
    <li>The night of sorrow now is turn’d to day:</li>
    <li>Her two blue windows faintly she upheaveth,</li>
    <li>Like the fair sun, when in his fresh array</li>
    <li class="number">He cheers the morn, and all the earth relieveth;</li>
    <li>And as the bright sun glorifies the sky,</li>
    <li>So is her face illumin’d with her eye,</li>
    <li>Whose beams upon his hairless face are fix’d,</li>
    <li>As if from thence they borrowed all their shine.</li>
    <li class="number">Were never four such lamps together mix’d,</li>
    <li>Had not his clouded with his brow’s repine;</li>
    <li>But hers, which through the crystal tears gave light,</li>
    <li>Shone like the moon in water seen by night.</li>
    <li>“O, where am I?” quoth she, “in earth or heaven,</li>
    <li class="number">Or in the ocean drench’d, or in the fire?</li>
    <li>What hour is this? Or morn or weary even?</li>
    <li>Do I delight to die, or life desire?</li>
    <li>But now I liv’d, and life was death’s annoy,</li>
    <li>But now I died, and death was lively joy.</li>
    <li class="number">O, thou didst kill me, kill me once again.</li>
    <li>Thy eyes’ shrewd tutor, that hard heart of thine,</li>
    <li>Hath taught them scornful tricks, and such disdain</li>
    <li>That they have murd’red this poor heart of mine,</li>
    <li>And these mine eyes, true leaders to their queen,</li>
    <li class="number">But for thy piteous lips no more had seen.</li>
    <li>Long may they kiss each other for this cure!</li>
    <li>O, never let their crimson liveries wear!</li>
    <li>And as they last, their verdour still endure,</li>
    <li>To drive infection from the dangerous year!</li>
    <li class="number">That the star-gazers, having writ on death,</li>
    <li>May say, the plague is banish’d by thy breath.</li>
    <li>Pure lips, sweet seals in my soft lips imprinted,</li>
    <li>What bargains may I make, still to be sealing?</li>
    <li>To sell myself I can be well contented,</li>
    <li class="number">So thou wilt buy, and pay, and use good dealing,</li>
    <li>Which purchase if thou make, for fear of slips,</li>
    <li>Set thy seal manual on my wax-red lips.</li>
    <li>A thousand kisses buys my heart from me,</li>
    <li>And pay them at thy leisure, one by one.</li>
    <li class="number">What is ten hundred touches unto thee?</li>
    <li>Are they not quickly told, and quickly gone?</li>
    <li>Say for non-payment that the debt should double,</li>
    <li>Is twenty hundred kisses such a trouble?”</li>
    <li>“Fair queen,” quoth he, “if any love you owe me,</li>
    <li class="number">Measure my strangeness with my unripe years;</li>
    <li>Before I know myself, seek not to know me,</li>
    <li>No fisher but the ungrown fry forbears;</li>
    <li>The mellow plum doth fall, the green sticks fast,</li>
    <li>Or being early pluck’d, is sour to taste.</li>
    <li class="number">Look the world’s comforter with weary gait</li>
    <li>His day’s hot task hath ended in the west;</li>
    <li>The owl (night’s herald) shrieks, ’tis very late;</li>
    <li>The sheep are gone to fold, birds to their nest,</li>
    <li>And coal-black clouds that shadow heaven’s light</li>
    <li class="number">Do summon us to part, and bid good night.</li>
    <li>Now let me say ‘Good night,’ and so say you;</li>
    <li>If you will say so, you shall have a kiss.”</li>
    <li>“Good night,” quoth she, and ere he says “Adieu,”</li>
    <li>The honey fee of parting tend’red is;</li>
    <li class="number">Her arms do lend his neck a sweet embrace;</li>
    <li>Incorporate then they seem, face grows to face;</li>
    <li>Till breathless he disjoin’d, and backward drew</li>
    <li>The heavenly moisture, that sweet coral mouth,</li>
    <li>Whose precious taste her thirsty lips well knew,</li>
    <li class="number">Whereon they surfeit, yet complain on drouth;</li>
    <li>He with her plenty press’d, she faint with dearth,</li>
    <li>Their lips together glued, fall to the earth.</li>
    <li>Now quick desire hath caught the yielding prey,</li>
    <li>And glutton-like she feeds, yet never filleth;</li>
    <li class="number">Her lips are conquerors, his lips obey,</li>
    <li>Paying what ransom the insulter willeth;</li>
    <li>Whose vulture thought doth pitch the price so high</li>
    <li>That she will draw his lips’ rich treasure dry.</li>
    <li>And having felt the sweetness of the spoil,</li>
    <li class="number">With blindfold fury she begins to forage;</li>
    <li>Her face doth reek and smoke, her blood doth boil,</li>
    <li>And careless lust stirs up a desperate courage,</li>
    <li>Planting oblivion, beating reason back,</li>
    <li>Forgetting shame’s pure blush and honor’s wrack.</li>
    <li class="number">Hot, faint, and weary, with her hard embracing,</li>
    <li>Like a wild bird being tam’d with too much handling,</li>
    <li>Or as the fleet-foot roe that’s tir’d with chasing,</li>
    <li>Or like the froward infant still’d with dandling,</li>
    <li>He now obeys, and now no more resisteth,</li>
    <li class="number">While she takes all she can, not all she listeth.</li>
    <li>What wax so frozen but dissolves with temp’ring,</li>
    <li>And yields at last to every light impression?</li>
    <li>Things out of hope are compass’d oft with vent’ring,</li>
    <li>Chiefly in love, whose leave exceeds commission;</li>
    <li class="number">Affection faints not like a pale-fac’d coward,</li>
    <li>But then woos best when most his choice is froward.</li>
    <li>When he did frown, O had she then gave over,</li>
    <li>Such nectar from his lips she had not suck’d.</li>
    <li>Foul words and frowns must not repel a lover;</li>
    <li class="number">What though the rose have prickles, yet ’tis pluck’d!</li>
    <li>Were beauty under twenty locks kept fast,</li>
    <li>Yet love breaks through, and picks them all at last.</li>
    <li>For pity now she can no more detain him;</li>
    <li>The poor fool prays her that he may depart.</li>
    <li class="number">She is resolv’d no longer to restrain him,</li>
    <li>Bids him farewell, and look well to her heart,</li>
    <li>The which, by Cupid’s bow she doth protest,</li>
    <li>He carries thence incaged in his breast.</li>
    <li>“Sweet boy,” she says, “this night I’ll waste in sorrow,</li>
    <li class="number">For my sick heart commands mine eyes to watch.</li>
    <li>Tell me, Love’s master, shall we meet tomorrow?</li>
    <li>Say, shall we, shall we? Wilt thou make the match?”</li>
    <li>He tells her no, tomorrow he intends</li>
    <li>To hunt the boar with certain of his friends.</li>
    <li class="number">“The boar!” quoth she, whereat a sudden pale,</li>
    <li>Like lawn being spread upon the blushing rose,</li>
    <li>Usurps her cheek; she trembles at his tale,</li>
    <li>And on his neck her yoking arms she throws.</li>
    <li>She sinketh down, still hanging by his neck,</li>
    <li class="number">He on her belly falls, she on her back.</li>
    <li>Now is she in the very lists of love,</li>
    <li>Her champion mounted for the hot encounter;</li>
    <li>All is imaginary she doth prove,</li>
    <li>He will not manage her, although he mount her,</li>
    <li class="number">That worse than Tantalus’ is her annoy,</li>
    <li>To clip Elysium and to lack her joy.</li>
    <li>Even so poor birds, deceiv’d with painted grapes,</li>
    <li>Do surfeit by the eye and pine the maw;</li>
    <li>Even so she languisheth in her mishaps,</li>
    <li class="number">As those poor birds that helpless berries saw.</li>
    <li>The warm effects which she in him finds missing</li>
    <li>She seeks to kindle with continual kissing.</li>
    <li>But all in vain, good queen, it will not be;</li>
    <li>She hath assay’d as much as may be prov’d.</li>
    <li class="number">Her pleading hath deserv’d a greater fee;</li>
    <li>She’s Love, she loves, and yet she is not lov’d.</li>
    <li>“Fie, fie,” he says, “you crush me, let me go,</li>
    <li>You have no reason to withhold me so.”</li>
    <li>“Thou hadst been gone,” quoth she, “sweet boy, ere this,</li>
    <li class="number">But that thou toldst me thou wouldst hunt the boar.</li>
    <li>O, be advis’d, thou know’st not what it is</li>
    <li>With javeling’s point a churlish swine to gore,</li>
    <li>Whose tushes never sheath’d he whetteth still,</li>
    <li>Like to a mortal butcher bent to kill.</li>
    <li class="number">On his bow-back he hath a battle set</li>
    <li>Of bristly pikes that ever threat his foes,</li>
    <li>His eyes like glow-worms shine when he doth fret,</li>
    <li>His snout digs sepulchres where e’er he goes;</li>
    <li>Being mov’d, he strikes, what e’er is in his way,</li>
    <li class="number">And whom he strikes his crooked tushes slay.</li>
    <li>His brawny sides, with hairy bristles armed,</li>
    <li>Are better proof than thy spear’s point can enter;</li>
    <li>His short thick neck cannot be easily harmed;</li>
    <li>Being ireful, on the lion he will venture.</li>
    <li class="number">The thorny brambles and embracing bushes,</li>
    <li>As fearful of him, part, through whom he rushes.</li>
    <li>Alas, he nought esteems that face of thine,</li>
    <li>To which Love’s eyes pays tributary gazes,</li>
    <li>Nor thy soft hands, sweet lips, and crystal eyne,</li>
    <li class="number">Whose full perfection all the world amazes,</li>
    <li>But having thee at vantage (wondrous dread!)</li>
    <li>Would root these beauties as he roots the mead.</li>
    <li>O, let him keep his loathsome cabin still!</li>
    <li>Beauty hath nought to do with such foul fiends.</li>
    <li class="number">Come not within his danger by thy will,</li>
    <li>They that thrive well take counsel of their friends.</li>
    <li>When thou didst name the boar, not to dissemble,</li>
    <li>I fear’d thy fortune, and my joints did tremble.</li>
    <li>Didst thou not mark my face? Was it not white?</li>
    <li class="number">Sawest thou not signs of fear lurk in mine eye?</li>
    <li>Grew I not faint, and fell I not downright?</li>
    <li>Within my bosom, whereon thou dost lie,</li>
    <li>My boding heart pants, beats, and takes no rest,</li>
    <li>But like an earthquake, shakes thee on my breast.</li>
    <li class="number">For where Love reigns, disturbing Jealousy</li>
    <li>Doth call himself Affection’s sentinel,</li>
    <li>Gives false alarms, suggesteth mutiny,</li>
    <li>And in a peaceful hour doth cry, “Kill, kill!”</li>
    <li>Distemp’ring gentle Love in his desire,</li>
    <li class="number">As air and water do abate the fire.</li>
    <li>This sour informer, this bate-breeding spy,</li>
    <li>This canker that eats up Love’s tender spring,</li>
    <li>This carry-tale, dissentious Jealousy,</li>
    <li>That sometime true news, sometime false doth bring,</li>
    <li class="number">Knocks at my heart, and whispers in mine ear,</li>
    <li>That if I love thee, I thy death should fear;</li>
    <li>And more than so, presenteth to mine eye</li>
    <li>The picture of an angry chafing boar,</li>
    <li>Under whose sharp fangs, on his back doth lie</li>
    <li class="number">An image like thyself, all stain’d with gore,</li>
    <li>Whose blood upon the fresh flowers being shed,</li>
    <li>Doth make them droop with grief and hang the head.</li>
    <li>What should I do, seeing thee so indeed,</li>
    <li>That tremble at th’ imagination?</li>
    <li class="number">The thought of it doth make my faint heart bleed,</li>
    <li>And fear doth teach it divination:</li>
    <li>I prophesy thy death, my living sorrow,</li>
    <li>If thou encounter with the boar tomorrow.</li>
    <li>But if thou needs wilt hunt, be rul’d by me,</li>
    <li class="number">Uncouple at the timorous flying hare,</li>
    <li>Or at the fox which lives by subtlety,</li>
    <li>Or at the roe which no encounter dare;</li>
    <li>Pursue these fearful creatures o’er the downs,</li>
    <li>And on thy well-breath’d horse keep with thy hounds.</li>
    <li class="number">And when thou hast on foot the purblind hare,</li>
    <li>Mark the poor wretch, to overshut his troubles,</li>
    <li>How he outruns the wind, and with what care</li>
    <li>He cranks and crosses with a thousand doubles:</li>
    <li>The many musits through the which he goes</li>
    <li class="number">Are like a labyrinth to amaze his foes.</li>
    <li>Sometime he runs among a flock of sheep,</li>
    <li>To make the cunning hounds mistake their smell,</li>
    <li>And sometime where earth-delving conies keep,</li>
    <li>To stop the loud pursuers in their yell,</li>
    <li class="number">And sometime sorteth with a herd of deer:</li>
    <li>Danger deviseth shifts, wit waits on fear.</li>
    <li>For there his smell with others being mingled,</li>
    <li>The hot scent-snuffing hounds are driven to doubt,</li>
    <li>Ceasing their clamorous cry till they have singled</li>
    <li class="number">With much ado the cold fault cleanly out;</li>
    <li>Then do they spend their mouths: echo replies,</li>
    <li>As if another chase were in the skies.</li>
    <li>By this, poor Wat, far off upon a hill,</li>
    <li>Stands on his hinder-legs with list’ning ear,</li>
    <li class="number">To hearken if his foes pursue him still.</li>
    <li>Anon their loud alarums he doth hear,</li>
    <li>And now his grief may be compared well</li>
    <li>To one sore sick that hears the passing bell.</li>
    <li>Then shalt thou see the dew-bedabbled wretch</li>
    <li class="number">Turn, and return, indenting with the way;</li>
    <li>Each envious brier his weary legs do scratch,</li>
    <li>Each shadow makes him stop, each murmur stay,</li>
    <li>For misery is trodden on by many,</li>
    <li>And being low, never reliev’d by any.</li>
    <li class="number">Lie quietly, and hear a little more,</li>
    <li>Nay, do not struggle, for thou shalt not rise.</li>
    <li>To make thee hate the hunting of the boar,</li>
    <li>Unlike myself thou hear’st me moralize,</li>
    <li>Applying this to that, and so to so,</li>
    <li class="number">For love can comment upon every woe.</li>
    <li>Where did I leave?” “No matter where,” quoth he,</li>
    <li>“Leave me, and then the story aptly ends;</li>
    <li>The night is spent.” “Why, what of that?” quoth she.</li>
    <li>“I am,” quoth he, “expected of my friends,</li>
    <li class="number">And now ’tis dark, and going I shall fall.”</li>
    <li>“In night,” quoth she, “desire sees best of all.</li>
    <li>But if thou fall, O then imagine this,</li>
    <li>The earth, in love with thee, thy footing trips,</li>
    <li>And all is but to rob thee of a kiss.</li>
    <li class="number">Rich preys make true men thieves; so do thy lips</li>
    <li>Make modest Dian cloudy and forlorn,</li>
    <li>Lest she should steal a kiss and die forsworn.</li>
    <li>Now of this dark night I perceive the reason:</li>
    <li>Cynthia for shame obscures her silver shine,</li>
    <li class="number">Till forging Nature be condemn’d of treason,</li>
    <li>For stealing moulds from heaven that were divine,</li>
    <li>Wherein she fram’d thee, in high heaven’s despite,</li>
    <li>To shame the sun by day, and her by night.</li>
    <li>And therefore hath she brib’d the Destinies</li>
    <li class="number">To cross the curious workmanship of Nature,</li>
    <li>To mingle beauty with infirmities,</li>
    <li>And pure perfection with impure defeature,</li>
    <li>Making it subject to the tyranny</li>
    <li>Of mad mischances and much misery:</li>
    <li class="number">As burning fevers, agues pale and faint,</li>
    <li>Life-poisoning pestilence, and frenzies wood,</li>
    <li>The marrow-eating sickness, whose attaint</li>
    <li>Disorder breeds by heating of the blood;</li>
    <li>Surfeits, impostumes, grief, and damn’d despair</li>
    <li class="number">Swear Nature’s death for framing thee so fair.</li>
    <li>And not the least of all these maladies</li>
    <li>But in one minute’s fight brings beauty under;</li>
    <li>Both favor, savor, hue, and qualities,</li>
    <li>Whereat th’ impartial gazer late did wonder,</li>
    <li class="number">Are on the sudden wasted, thaw’d, and done,</li>
    <li>As mountain snow melts with the midday sun.</li>
    <li>Therefore despite of fruitless chastity,</li>
    <li>Love-lacking vestals, and self-loving nuns,</li>
    <li>That on the earth would breed a scarcity</li>
    <li class="number">And barren dearth of daughters and of sons,</li>
    <li>Be prodigal: the lamp that burns by night</li>
    <li>Dries up his oil to lend the world his light.</li>
    <li>What is thy body but a swallowing grave,</li>
    <li>Seeming to bury that posterity</li>
    <li class="number">Which by the rights of time thou needs must have,</li>
    <li>If thou destroy them not in dark obscurity?</li>
    <li>If so, the world will hold thee in disdain,</li>
    <li>Sith in thy pride so fair a hope is slain.</li>
    <li>So in thyself thyself art made away,</li>
    <li class="number">A mischief worse than civil home-bred strife,</li>
    <li>Or theirs whose desperate hands themselves do slay,</li>
    <li>Or butcher sire that reaves his son of life.</li>
    <li>Foul cank’ring rust the hidden treasure frets,</li>
    <li>But gold that’s put to use more gold begets.”</li>
    <li class="number">“Nay then,” quoth Adon, “you will fall again</li>
    <li>Into your idle over-handled theme.</li>
    <li>The kiss I gave you is bestow’d in vain,</li>
    <li>And all in vain you strive against the stream,</li>
    <li>For by this black-fac’d night, desire’s foul nurse,</li>
    <li class="number">Your treatise makes me like you worse and worse.</li>
    <li>If love have lent you twenty thousand tongues,</li>
    <li>And every tongue more moving than your own,</li>
    <li>Bewitching like the wanton mermaids’ songs,</li>
    <li>Yet from mine ear the tempting tune is blown;</li>
    <li class="number">For know my heart stands armed in mine ear,</li>
    <li>And will not let a false sound enter there,</li>
    <li>Lest the deceiving harmony should run</li>
    <li>Into the quiet closure of my breast,</li>
    <li>And then my little heart were quite undone,</li>
    <li class="number">In his bedchamber to be barr’d of rest.</li>
    <li>No, lady, no, my heart longs not to groan,</li>
    <li>But soundly sleeps, while now it sleeps alone.</li>
    <li>What have you urg’d that I cannot reprove?</li>
    <li>The path is smooth that leadeth on to danger.</li>
    <li class="number">I hate not love, but your device in love,</li>
    <li>That lends embracements unto every stranger.</li>
    <li>You do it for increase: O strange excuse!</li>
    <li>When reason is the bawd to lust’s abuse.</li>
    <li>Call it not love, for Love to heaven is fled,</li>
    <li class="number">Since sweating Lust on earth usurp’d his name,</li>
    <li>Under whose simple semblance he hath fed</li>
    <li>Upon fresh beauty, blotting it with blame;</li>
    <li>Which the hot tyrant stains, and soon bereaves,</li>
    <li>As caterpillars do the tender leaves.</li>
    <li class="number">Love comforteth like sunshine after rain,</li>
    <li>But Lust’s effect is tempest after sun;</li>
    <li>Love’s gentle spring doth always fresh remain,</li>
    <li>Lust’s winter comes ere summer half be done;</li>
    <li>Love surfeits not, Lust like a glutton dies;</li>
    <li class="number">Love is all truth, Lust full of forged lies.</li>
    <li>More I could tell, but more I dare not say,</li>
    <li>The text is old, the orator too green,</li>
    <li>Therefore in sadness, now I will away;</li>
    <li>My face is full of shame, my heart of teen,</li>
    <li class="number">Mine ears, that to your wanton talk attended,</li>
    <li>Do burn themselves for having so offended.”</li>
    <li>With this he breaketh from the sweet embrace</li>
    <li>Of those fair arms which bound him to her breast,</li>
    <li>And homeward through the dark laund runs apace,</li>
    <li class="number">Leaves Love upon her back, deeply distress’d.</li>
    <li>Look how a bright star shooteth from the sky,</li>
    <li>So glides he in the night from Venus’ eye,</li>
    <li>Which after him she darts, as one on shore</li>
    <li>Gazing upon a late embarked friend,</li>
    <li class="number">Till the wild waves will have him seen no more,</li>
    <li>Whose ridges with the meeting clouds contend;</li>
    <li>So did the merciless and pitchy night</li>
    <li>Fold in the object that did feed her sight.</li>
    <li>Whereat amaz’d as one that unaware</li>
    <li class="number">Hath dropp’d a precious jewel in the flood,</li>
    <li>Or stonish’d as night-wand’rers often are,</li>
    <li>Their light blown out in some mistrustful wood,</li>
    <li>Even so confounded in the dark she lay,</li>
    <li>Having lost the fair discovery of her way.</li>
    <li class="number">And now she beats her heart, whereat it groans,</li>
    <li>That all the neighbor caves, as seeming troubled,</li>
    <li>Make verbal repetition of her moans;</li>
    <li>Passion on passion deeply is redoubled:</li>
    <li>“Ay me!” she cries, and twenty times, “Woe, woe!”</li>
    <li class="number">And twenty echoes twenty times cry so.</li>
    <li>She marking them begins a wailing note,</li>
    <li>And sings extemporally a woeful ditty,</li>
    <li>How love makes young men thrall, and old men dote,</li>
    <li>How love is wise in folly, foolish witty.</li>
    <li class="number">Her heavy anthem still concludes in woe,</li>
    <li>And still the choir of echoes answer so.</li>
    <li>Her song was tedious, and outwore the night,</li>
    <li>For lovers’ hours are long, though seeming short;</li>
    <li>If pleas’d themselves, others they think delight</li>
    <li class="number">In such-like circumstance, with such-like sport.</li>
    <li>Their copious stories, oftentimes begun,</li>
    <li>End without audience, and are never done.</li>
    <li>For who hath she to spend the night withal,</li>
    <li>But idle sounds resembling parasites,</li>
    <li class="number">Like shrill-tongu’d tapsters answering every call,</li>
    <li>Soothing the humor of fantastic wits?</li>
    <li>She says, “’Tis so,” they answer all, “’Tis so,”</li>
    <li>And would say after her, if she said “No.”</li>
    <li>Lo here the gentle lark, weary of rest,</li>
    <li class="number">From his moist cabinet mounts up on high,</li>
    <li>And wakes the morning, from whose silver breast</li>
    <li>The sun ariseth in his majesty,</li>
    <li>Who doth the world so gloriously behold</li>
    <li>That cedar tops and hills seem burnish’d gold.</li>
    <li class="number">Venus salutes him with this fair good morrow:</li>
    <li>“O thou clear god, and patron of all light,</li>
    <li>From whom each lamp and shining star doth borrow</li>
    <li>The beauteous influence that makes him bright,</li>
    <li>There lives a son that suck’d an earthly mother,</li>
    <li class="number">May lend thee light, as thou dost lend to other.”</li>
    <li>This said, she hasteth to a myrtle grove,</li>
    <li>Musing the morning is so much o’erworn,</li>
    <li>And yet she hears no tidings of her love.</li>
    <li>She hearkens for his hounds and for his horn;</li>
    <li class="number">Anon she hears them chaunt it lustily,</li>
    <li>And all in haste she coasteth to the cry.</li>
    <li>And as she runs, the bushes in the way,</li>
    <li>Some catch her by the neck, some kiss her face,</li>
    <li>Some twin’d about her thigh to make her stay.</li>
    <li class="number">She wildly breaketh from their strict embrace,</li>
    <li>Like a milch doe, whose swelling dugs do ache,</li>
    <li>Hasting to feed her fawn hid in some brake.</li>
    <li>By this she hears the hounds are at a bay,</li>
    <li>Whereat she starts like one that spies an adder</li>
    <li class="number">Wreath’d up in fatal folds just in his way,</li>
    <li>The fear whereof doth make him shake and shudder;</li>
    <li>Even so the timorous yelping of the hounds</li>
    <li>Appalls her senses, and her spirit confounds.</li>
    <li>For now she knows it is no gentle chase,</li>
    <li class="number">But the blunt boar, rough bear, or lion proud,</li>
    <li>Because the cry remaineth in one place,</li>
    <li>Where fearfully the dogs exclaim aloud;</li>
    <li>Finding their enemy to be so curst,</li>
    <li>They all strain court’sy who shall cope him first.</li>
    <li class="number">This dismal cry rings sadly in her ear,</li>
    <li>Through which it enters to surprise her heart,</li>
    <li>Who overcome by doubt, and bloodless fear,</li>
    <li>With cold-pale weakness numbs each feeling part:</li>
    <li>Like soldiers when their captain once doth yield,</li>
    <li class="number">They basely fly, and dare not stay the field.</li>
    <li>Thus stands she in a trembling ecstasy,</li>
    <li>Till cheering up her senses all dismay’d,</li>
    <li>She tells them ’tis a causeless fantasy,</li>
    <li>And childish error that they are afraid;</li>
    <li class="number">Bids them leave quaking, bids them fear no more—</li>
    <li>And with that word, she spied the hunted boar,</li>
    <li>Whose frothy mouth bepainted all with red,</li>
    <li>Like milk and blood being mingled both together,</li>
    <li>A second fear through all her sinews spread,</li>
    <li class="number">Which madly hurries her she knows not whither;</li>
    <li>This way she runs, and now she will no further,</li>
    <li>But back retires to rate the boar for murder.</li>
    <li>A thousand spleens bear her a thousand ways,</li>
    <li>She treads the path that she untreads again;</li>
    <li class="number">Her more than haste is mated with delays,</li>
    <li>Like the proceedings of a drunken brain,</li>
    <li>Full of respects, yet nought at all respecting,</li>
    <li>In hand with all things, nought at all effecting.</li>
    <li>Here kennell’d in a brake she finds a hound,</li>
    <li class="number">And asks the weary caitiff for his master,</li>
    <li>And there another licking of his wound,</li>
    <li>’Gainst venom’d sores the only sovereign plaster,</li>
    <li>And here she meets another sadly scowling,</li>
    <li>To whom she speaks, and he replies with howling.</li>
    <li class="number">When he hath ceas’d his ill-resounding noise,</li>
    <li>Another flap-mouth’d mourner, black and grim,</li>
    <li>Against the welkin volleys out his voice;</li>
    <li>Another, and another, answer him,</li>
    <li>Clapping their proud tails to the ground below,</li>
    <li class="number">Shaking their scratch’d ears, bleeding as they go.</li>
    <li>Look how the world’s poor people are amazed</li>
    <li>At apparitions, signs, and prodigies,</li>
    <li>Whereon with fearful eyes they long have gazed,</li>
    <li>Infusing them with dreadful prophecies;</li>
    <li class="number">So she at these sad signs draws up her breath,</li>
    <li>And sighing it again, exclaims on Death.</li>
    <li>“Hard-favor’d tyrant, ugly, meagre, lean,</li>
    <li>Hateful divorce of love”—thus chides she Death—</li>
    <li>“Grim-grinning ghost, earth’s worm, what dost thou mean</li>
    <li class="number">To stifle beauty, and to steal his breath?</li>
    <li>Who when he liv’d, his breath and beauty set</li>
    <li>Gloss on the rose, smell to the violet.</li>
    <li>If he be dead—O no, it cannot be,</li>
    <li>Seeing his beauty, thou shouldst strike at it:</li>
    <li class="number">O yes, it may, thou hast no eyes to see,</li>
    <li>But hatefully at random dost thou hit.</li>
    <li>Thy mark is feeble age, but thy false dart</li>
    <li>Mistakes that aim, and cleaves an infant’s heart.</li>
    <li>Hadst thou but bid beware, then he had spoke,</li>
    <li class="number">And hearing him, thy power had lost his power.</li>
    <li>The Destinies will curse thee for this stroke:</li>
    <li>They bid thee crop a weed, thou pluck’st a flower.</li>
    <li>Love’s golden arrow at him should have fled,</li>
    <li>And not Death’s ebon dart to strike him dead.</li>
    <li class="number">Dost thou drink tears, that thou provok’st such weeping?</li>
    <li>What may a heavy groan advantage thee?</li>
    <li>Why hast thou cast into eternal sleeping</li>
    <li>Those eyes that taught all other eyes to see?</li>
    <li>Now Nature cares not for thy mortal vigor,</li>
    <li class="number">Since her best work is ruin’d with thy rigor.”</li>
    <li>Here overcome, as one full of despair,</li>
    <li>She vail’d her eyelids, who like sluices stopp’d</li>
    <li>The crystal tide that from her two cheeks fair</li>
    <li>In the sweet channel of her bosom dropp’d;</li>
    <li class="number">But through the flood-gates breaks the silver rain,</li>
    <li>And with his strong course opens them again.</li>
    <li>O how her eyes and tears did lend and borrow!</li>
    <li>Her eye seen in the tears, tears in her eye,</li>
    <li>Both crystals, where they view’d each other’s sorrow,</li>
    <li class="number">Sorrow that friendly sighs sought still to dry;</li>
    <li>But like a stormy day, now wind, now rain,</li>
    <li>Sighs dry her cheeks, tears make them wet again.</li>
    <li>Variable passions throng her constant woe,</li>
    <li>As striving who should best become her grief;</li>
    <li class="number">All entertain’d, each passion labors so,</li>
    <li>That every present sorrow seemeth chief,</li>
    <li>But none is best; then join they all together,</li>
    <li>Like many clouds consulting for foul weather.</li>
    <li>By this, far off, she hears some huntsman hallow;</li>
    <li class="number">A nurse’s song ne’er pleas’d her babe so well.</li>
    <li>The dire imagination she did follow</li>
    <li>This sound of hope doth labor to expel,</li>
    <li>For now reviving joy bids her rejoice,</li>
    <li>And flatters her it is Adonis’ voice.</li>
    <li class="number">Whereat her tears began to turn their tide,</li>
    <li>Being prison’d in her eye, like pearls in glass,</li>
    <li>Yet sometimes falls an orient drop beside,</li>
    <li>Which her cheek melts, as scorning it should pass</li>
    <li>To wash the foul face of the sluttish ground,</li>
    <li class="number">Who is but drunken when she seemeth drown’d.</li>
    <li>O hard-believing love, how strange it seems!</li>
    <li>Not to believe, and yet too credulous:</li>
    <li>Thy weal and woe are both of them extremes;</li>
    <li>Despair and hope makes thee ridiculous:</li>
    <li class="number">The one doth flatter thee in thoughts unlikely,</li>
    <li>In likely thoughts the other kills thee quickly.</li>
    <li>Now she unweaves the web that she hath wrought,</li>
    <li>Adonis lives, and Death is not to blame;</li>
    <li>It was not she that call’d him all to naught;</li>
    <li class="number">Now she adds honors to his hateful name:</li>
    <li>She clepes him king of graves, and grave for kings,</li>
    <li>Imperious supreme of all mortal things.</li>
    <li>“No, no,” quoth she, “sweet Death, I did but jest,</li>
    <li>Yet pardon me, I felt a kind of fear</li>
    <li class="number">When as I met the boar, that bloody beast,</li>
    <li>Which knows no pity, but is still severe;</li>
    <li>Then, gentle shadow (truth I must confess),</li>
    <li>I rail’d on thee, fearing my love’s decesse.</li>
    <li>’Tis not my fault, the boar provok’d my tongue,</li>
    <li class="number">Be wreak’d on him, invisible commander;</li>
    <li>’Tis he, foul creature, that hath done thee wrong,</li>
    <li>I did but act, he’s author of thy slander.</li>
    <li>Grief hath two tongues, and never woman yet</li>
    <li>Could rule them both without ten women’s wit.”</li>
    <li class="number">Thus hoping that Adonis is alive,</li>
    <li>Her rash suspect she doth extenuate,</li>
    <li>And that his beauty may the better thrive,</li>
    <li>With Death she humbly doth insinuate;</li>
    <li>Tells him of trophies, statues, tombs, and stories</li>
    <li class="number">His victories, his triumphs, and his glories.</li>
    <li>“O Jove,” quoth she, “how much a fool was I,</li>
    <li>To be of such a weak and silly mind,</li>
    <li>To wail his death who lives, and must not die</li>
    <li>Till mutual overthrow of mortal kind!</li>
    <li class="number">For he being dead, with him is beauty slain,</li>
    <li>And beauty dead, black chaos comes again.</li>
    <li>Fie, fie, fond love, thou art as full of fear</li>
    <li>As one with treasure laden, hemm’d with thieves;</li>
    <li>Trifles, unwitnessed with eye or ear,</li>
    <li class="number">Thy coward heart with false bethinking grieves.”</li>
    <li>Even at this word she hears a merry horn,</li>
    <li>Whereat she leaps, that was but late forlorn.</li>
    <li>As falcons to the lure, away she flies,</li>
    <li>The grass stoops not, she treads on it so light,</li>
    <li class="number">And in her haste unfortunately spies</li>
    <li>The foul boar’s conquest on her fair delight,</li>
    <li>Which seen, her eyes as murd’red with the view,</li>
    <li>Like stars asham’d of day, themselves withdrew;</li>
    <li>Or as the snail, whose tender horns being hit,</li>
    <li class="number">Shrinks backward in his shelly cave with pain,</li>
    <li>And there, all smoth’red up, in shade doth sit,</li>
    <li>Long after fearing to creep forth again;</li>
    <li>So at his bloody view her eyes are fled</li>
    <li>Into the deep-dark cabins of her head,</li>
    <li class="number">Where they resign their office, and their light,</li>
    <li>To the disposing of her troubled brain,</li>
    <li>Who bids them still consort with ugly night,</li>
    <li>And never wound the heart with looks again,</li>
    <li>Who like a king perplexed in his throne,</li>
    <li class="number">By their suggestion, gives a deadly groan.</li>
    <li>Whereat each tributary subject quakes,</li>
    <li>As when the wind imprison’d in the ground,</li>
    <li>Struggling for passage, earth’s foundation shakes,</li>
    <li>Which with cold terror doth men’s minds confound.</li>
    <li class="number">This mutiny each part doth so surprise</li>
    <li>That from their dark beds once more leap her eyes,</li>
    <li>And being open’d, threw unwilling light</li>
    <li>Upon the wide wound that the boar had trench’d</li>
    <li>In his soft flank, whose wonted lily white</li>
    <li class="number">With purple tears, that his wound wept, was drench’d.</li>
    <li>No flow’r was nigh, no grass, herb, leaf, or weed,</li>
    <li>But stole his blood, and seem’d with him to bleed.</li>
    <li>This solemn sympathy poor Venus noteth,</li>
    <li>Over one shoulder doth she hang her head;</li>
    <li class="number">Dumbly she passions, franticly she doteth,</li>
    <li>She thinks he could not die, he is not dead;</li>
    <li>Her voice is stopp’d, her joints forget to bow,</li>
    <li>Her eyes are mad that they have wept till now.</li>
    <li>Upon his hurt she looks so steadfastly,</li>
    <li class="number">That her sight dazzling makes the wound seem three,</li>
    <li>And then she reprehends her mangling eye,</li>
    <li>That makes more gashes where no breach should be.</li>
    <li>His face seems twain, each several limb is doubled,</li>
    <li>For oft the eye mistakes, the brain being troubled.</li>
    <li class="number">“My tongue cannot express my grief for one,</li>
    <li>And yet,” quoth she, “behold two Adons dead!</li>
    <li>My sighs are blown away, my salt tears gone,</li>
    <li>Mine eyes are turn’d to fire, my heart to lead:</li>
    <li>Heavy heart’s lead, melt at mine eyes’ red fire,</li>
    <li class="number">So shall I die by drops of hot desire.</li>
    <li>Alas, poor world, what treasure hast thou lost!</li>
    <li>What face remains alive that’s worth the viewing?</li>
    <li>Whose tongue is music now? What canst thou boast</li>
    <li>Of things long since, or any thing ensuing?</li>
    <li class="number">The flowers are sweet, their colors fresh and trim,</li>
    <li>But true sweet beauty liv’d and died with him.</li>
    <li>Bonnet nor veil henceforth no creature wear!</li>
    <li>Nor sun nor wind will ever strive to kiss you:</li>
    <li>Having no fair to lose, you need not fear,</li>
    <li class="number">The sun doth scorn you, and the wind doth hiss you.</li>
    <li>But when Adonis liv’d, sun and sharp air</li>
    <li>Lurk’d like two thieves, to rob him of his fair.</li>
    <li>And therefore would he put his bonnet on,</li>
    <li>Under whose brim the gaudy sun would peep;</li>
    <li class="number">The wind would blow it off, and being gone,</li>
    <li>Play with his locks; then would Adonis weep;</li>
    <li>And straight, in pity of his tender years,</li>
    <li>They both would strive who first should dry his tears.</li>
    <li>To see his face the lion walk’d along</li>
    <li class="number">Behind some hedge, because he would not fear him;</li>
    <li>To recreate himself when he hath song,</li>
    <li>The tiger would be tame, and gently hear him;</li>
    <li>If he had spoke, the wolf would leave his prey,</li>
    <li>And never fright the silly lamb that day.</li>
    <li class="number">When he beheld his shadow in the brook,</li>
    <li>The fishes spread on it their golden gills;</li>
    <li>When he was by, the birds such pleasure took,</li>
    <li>That some would sing, some other in their bills</li>
    <li>Would bring him mulberries and ripe-red cherries:</li>
    <li class="number">He fed them with his sight, they him with berries.</li>
    <li>But this foul, grim, and urchin-snouted boar,</li>
    <li>Whose downward eye still looketh for a grave,</li>
    <li>Ne’er saw the beauteous livery that he wore—</li>
    <li>Witness the entertainment that he gave.</li>
    <li class="number">If he did see his face, why then I know</li>
    <li>He thought to kiss him, and hath kill’d him so.</li>
    <li>’Tis true, ’tis true, thus was Adonis slain:</li>
    <li>He ran upon the boar with his sharp spear,</li>
    <li>Who did not whet his teeth at him again,</li>
    <li class="number">But by a kiss thought to persuade him there;</li>
    <li>And nousling in his flank, the loving swine</li>
    <li>Sheath’d unaware the tusk in his soft groin.</li>
    <li>Had I been tooth’d like him, I must confess,</li>
    <li>With kissing him I should have kill’d him first,</li>
    <li class="number">But he is dead, and never did he bless</li>
    <li>My youth with his, the more am I accurs’d.”</li>
    <li>With this she falleth in the place she stood,</li>
    <li>And stains her face with his congealed blood.</li>
    <li>She looks upon his lips, and they are pale,</li>
    <li class="number">She takes him by the hand, and that is cold,</li>
    <li>She whispers in his ears a heavy tale,</li>
    <li>As if they heard the woeful words she told;</li>
    <li>She lifts the coffer-lids that close his eyes,</li>
    <li>Where lo, two lamps burnt out in darkness lies;</li>
    <li class="number">Two glasses, where herself herself beheld</li>
    <li>A thousand times, and now no more reflect,</li>
    <li>Their virtue lost, wherein they late excell’d,</li>
    <li>And every beauty robb’d of his effect.</li>
    <li>“Wonder of time,” quoth she, “this is my spite,</li>
    <li class="number">That thou being dead, the day should yet be light.</li>
    <li>Since thou art dead, lo here I prophesy,</li>
    <li>Sorrow on love hereafter shall attend;</li>
    <li>It shall be waited on with jealousy,</li>
    <li>Find sweet beginning, but unsavory end;</li>
    <li class="number">Ne’er settled equally, but high or low,</li>
    <li>That all love’s pleasure shall not match his woe.</li>
    <li>It shall be fickle, false, and full of fraud,</li>
    <li>Bud, and be blasted, in a breathing while,</li>
    <li>The bottom poison, and the top o’erstraw’d</li>
    <li class="number">With sweets that shall the truest sight beguile;</li>
    <li>The strongest body shall it make most weak,</li>
    <li>Strike the wise dumb, and teach the fool to speak.</li>
    <li>It shall be sparing, and too full of riot,</li>
    <li>Teaching decrepit age to tread the measures;</li>
    <li class="number">The staring ruffian shall it keep in quiet,</li>
    <li>Pluck down the rich, enrich the poor with treasures;</li>
    <li>It shall be raging mad, and silly mild,</li>
    <li>Make the young old, the old become a child.</li>
    <li>It shall suspect where is no cause of fear,</li>
    <li class="number">It shall not fear where it should most mistrust,</li>
    <li>It shall be merciful, and too severe,</li>
    <li>And most deceiving when it seems most just;</li>
    <li>Perverse it shall be, where it shows most toward,</li>
    <li>Put fear to valor, courage to the coward.</li>
    <li class="number">It shall be cause of war and dire events,</li>
    <li>And set dissension ’twixt the son and sire,</li>
    <li>Subject and servile to all discontents,</li>
    <li>As dry combustious matter is to fire.</li>
    <li>Sith in his prime, Death doth my love destroy,</li>
    <li class="number">They that love best, their loves shall not enjoy.”</li>
    <li>By this the boy that by her side lay kill’d</li>
    <li>Was melted like a vapor from her sight,</li>
    <li>And in his blood that on the ground lay spill’d,</li>
    <li>A purple flow’r sprung up, check’red with white,</li>
    <li class="number">Resembling well his pale cheeks and the blood</li>
    <li>Which in round drops upon their whiteness stood.</li>
    <li>She bows her head, the new-sprung flow’r to smell,</li>
    <li>Comparing it to her Adonis’ breath,</li>
    <li>And says within her bosom it shall dwell,</li>
    <li class="number">Since he himself is reft from her by death.</li>
    <li>She crops the stalk, and in the breach appears</li>
    <li>Green-dropping sap, which she compares to tears.</li>
    <li>“Poor flow’r,” quoth she, “this was thy father’s guise—</li>
    <li>Sweet issue of a more sweet-smelling sire—</li>
    <li class="number">For every little grief to wet his eyes;</li>
    <li>To grow unto himself was his desire,</li>
    <li>And so ’tis thine, but know it is as good</li>
    <li>To wither in my breast as in his blood.</li>
    <li>Here was thy father’s bed, here in my breast;</li>
    <li class="number">Thou art the next of blood, and ’tis thy right.</li>
    <li>Lo in this hollow cradle take thy rest,</li>
    <li>My throbbing heart shall rock thee day and night;</li>
    <li>There shall not be one minute in an hour</li>
    <li>Wherein I will not kiss my sweet love’s flow’r.”</li>
    <li class="number">Thus weary of the world, away she hies,</li>
    <li>And yokes her silver doves, by whose swift aid</li>
    <li>Their mistress mounted through the empty skies,</li>
    <li>In her light chariot, quickly is convey’d,</li>
    <li>Holding their course to Paphos, where their queen</li>
    <li class="number">Means to immure herself, and not be seen.</li>
