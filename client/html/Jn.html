  <li class="number">Now say, Chatillion, what would France with us?</li>

<ol data-speaker="CHAT.">
  <li class="number">Thus, after greeting, speaks the King of France</li>
  <li class="number">In my behavior to the majesty,</li>
  <li class="number">The borrowed majesty, of England here.</li>

<ol data-speaker="EL.">
  <li class="number">A strange beginning: “borrowed majesty”!</li>

  <li class="number">Silence, good mother, hear the embassy.</li>

  <li class="number">Philip of France, in right and true behalf</li>
  <li class="number">Of thy deceased brother Geffrey’s son,</li>

  <li class="number">To this fair island and the territories,</li>
  <li class="number">To Ireland, Poictiers, Anjou, Touraine, Maine,</li>
  <li class="number">Desiring thee to lay aside the sword</li>
  <li class="number">Which sways usurpingly these several titles,</li>
  <li class="number">And put the same into young Arthur’s hand,</li>
  <li class="number">Thy nephew and right royal sovereign.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="K. JOHN.">
  <li class="number">What follows if we disallow of this?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CHAT.">
  <li class="number">The proud control of fierce and bloody war,</li>
  <li class="number">To enforce these rights so forcibly withheld.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="K. JOHN.">
  <li class="number">Here have we war for war and blood for blood,</li>
  <li class="number">Controlment for controlment: so answer France.</li>

  <li class="number">Then take my King’s defiance from my mouth,</li>

  <li class="number">The thunder of my cannon shall be heard.</li>
  <li class="number">So hence! Be thou the trumpet of our wrath,</li>
  <li class="number">And sullen presage of your own decay.</li>
  <li class="number">An honorable conduct let him have.</li>

  <li class="number">What now, my son, have I not ever said</li>

  <li class="number">Till she had kindled France, and all the world,</li>
  <li class="number">Upon the right and party of her son?</li>
  <li class="number">This might have been prevented and made whole</li>

</li>
  <li class="number">What men are you?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BAST.">
  <li class="number">Your faithful subject I, a gentleman,</li>
  <li class="number">Born in Northamptonshire, and eldest son,</li>
  <li class="number">As I suppose, to Robert Faulconbridge,</li>
  <li class="number">A soldier, by the honor-giving hand</li>
  <li class="number">Of Coeur de Lion knighted in the field.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="K. JOHN.">
  <li class="number">What art thou?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROB.">
  <li class="number">The son and heir to that same Faulconbridge.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="K. JOHN.">
  <li class="number">Is that the elder, and art thou the heir?</li>
  <li class="number">You came not of one mother then, it seems.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BAST.">
  <li class="number">Most certain of one mother, mighty King—</li>
  <li class="number">That is well known—and, as I think, one father;</li>
  <li class="number">But for the certain knowledge of that truth</li>
  <li class="number">I put you o’er to heaven and to my mother.</li>
  <li class="number">Of that I doubt, as all men’s children may.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="EL.">
  <li class="number">Out on thee, rude man, thou dost shame thy mother,</li>
  <li class="number">And wound her honor with this diffidence.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BAST.">
  <li class="number">I, madam? No, I have no reason for it;</li>
  <li class="number">That is my brother’s plea and none of mine,</li>
  <li class="number">The which if he can prove, ’a pops me out</li>
  <li class="number">At least from fair five hundred pound a year.</li>
  <li class="number">Heaven guard my mother’s honor, and my land!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="K. JOHN.">
  <li class="number">A good blunt fellow. Why, being younger born,</li>
  <li class="number">Doth he lay claim to thine inheritance?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BAST.">
  <li class="number">I know not why, except to get the land;</li>
  <li class="number">But once he slander’d me with bastardy.</li>
  <li class="number">But whe’er I be as true begot or no,</li>
  <li class="number">That still I lay upon my mother’s head,</li>
  <li class="number">But that I am as well begot, my liege</li>
  <li class="number">(Fair fall the bones that took the pains for me!),</li>
  <li class="number">Compare our faces, and be judge yourself.</li>
  <li class="number">If old Sir Robert did beget us both,</li>
  <li class="number">And were our father, and this son like him,</li>
  <li class="number">O old Sir Robert, father, on my knee</li>
  <li class="number">I give heaven thanks I was not like to thee!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="K. JOHN.">
  <li class="number">Why, what a madcap hath heaven lent us here!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="EL.">
  <li class="number">He hath a trick of Coeur de Lion’s face,</li>
  <li class="number">The accent of his tongue affecteth him.</li>
  <li class="number">Do you not read some tokens of my son</li>
  <li class="number">In the large composition of this man?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="K. JOHN.">
  <li class="number">Mine eye hath well examined his parts,</li>
  <li class="number">And finds them perfect Richard. Sirrah, speak,</li>
  <li class="number">What doth move you to claim your brother’s land?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BAST.">
  <li class="number">Because he hath a half-face like my father!</li>
  <li class="number">With half that face would he have all my land—</li>
  <li class="number">A half-fac’d groat five hundred pound a year!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROB.">
  <li class="number">My gracious liege, when that my father liv’d,</li>
  <li class="number">Your brother did employ my father much—</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BAST.">
  <li class="number">Well, sir, by this you cannot get my land;</li>
  <li class="number">Your tale must be how he employ’d my mother.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROB.">
  <li class="number">And once dispatch’d him in an embassy</li>
  <li class="number">To Germany, there with the Emperor</li>
  <li class="number">To treat of high affairs touching that time.</li>
  <li class="number">Th’ advantage of his absence took the King,</li>
  <li class="number">And in the mean time sojourn’d at my father’s;</li>
  <li class="number">Where how he did prevail I shame to speak.</li>
  <li class="number">But truth is truth. Large lengths of seas and shores</li>
  <li class="number">Between my father and my mother lay,</li>
  <li class="number">As I have heard my father speak himself,</li>
  <li class="number">When this same lusty gentleman was got.</li>
  <li class="number">Upon his death-bed he by will bequeath’d</li>
  <li class="number">His lands to me, and took it on his death</li>
  <li class="number">That this my mother’s son was none of his;</li>
  <li class="number">And if he were, he came into the world</li>
  <li class="number">Full fourteen weeks before the course of time.</li>
  <li class="number">Then, good my liege, let me have what is mine,</li>
  <li class="number">My father’s land, as was my father’s will.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="K. JOHN.">
  <li class="number">Sirrah, your brother is legitimate,</li>
  <li class="number">Your father’s wife did after wedlock bear him;</li>
  <li class="number">And if she did play false, the fault was hers,</li>
  <li class="number">Which fault lies on the hazards of all husbands</li>
  <li class="number">That marry wives. Tell me, how if my brother,</li>
  <li class="number">Who, as you say, took pains to get this son,</li>
  <li class="number">Had of your father claim’d this son for his?</li>
  <li class="number">In sooth, good friend, your father might have kept</li>
  <li class="number">This calf, bred from his cow, from all the world;</li>
  <li class="number">In sooth he might; then if he were my brother’s,</li>
  <li class="number">My brother might not claim him, nor your father,</li>
  <li class="number">Being none of his, refuse him. This concludes:</li>
  <li class="number">My mother’s son did get your father’s heir;</li>
  <li class="number">Your father’s heir must have your father’s land.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROB.">
  <li class="number">Shall then my father’s will be of no force</li>
  <li class="number">To dispossess that child which is not his?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BAST.">
  <li class="number">Of no more force to dispossess me, sir,</li>
  <li class="number">Than was his will to get me, as I think.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="EL.">
  <li class="number">Whether hadst thou rather be a Faulconbridge,</li>
  <li class="number">And like thy brother, to enjoy thy land;</li>
  <li class="number">Or the reputed son of Coeur de Lion,</li>
  <li class="number">Lord of thy presence and no land beside?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BAST.">
  <li class="number">Madam, and if my brother had my shape</li>
  <li class="number">And I had his, Sir Robert’s his, like him,</li>
  <li class="number">And if my legs were two such riding-rods,</li>
  <li class="number">My arms such eel-skins stuff’d, my face so thin</li>
  <li class="number">That in mine ear I durst not stick a rose</li>
  <li class="number">Lest men should say, “Look where three-farthings goes!”</li>
  <li class="number">And to his shape were heir to all this land,</li>
  <li class="number">Would I might never stir from off this place,</li>
  <li class="number">I would give it every foot to have this face;</li>
  <li class="number">It would not be Sir Nob in any case.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="EL.">
  <li class="number">I like thee well. Wilt thou forsake thy fortune,</li>
  <li class="number">Bequeath thy land to him, and follow me?</li>
  <li class="number">I am a soldier, and now bound to France.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BAST.">
  <li class="number">Brother, take you my land, I’ll take my chance.</li>
  <li class="number">Your face hath got five hundred pound a year,</li>
  <li class="number">Yet sell your face for five pence and ’tis dear.</li>
  <li class="number">Madam, I’ll follow you unto the death.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="EL.">
  <li class="number">Nay, I would have you go before me thither.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BAST.">
  <li class="number">Our country manners give our betters way.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="K. JOHN.">
  <li class="number">What is thy name?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BAST.">
  <li class="number">Philip, my liege, so is my name begun,</li>
  <li class="number">Philip, good old Sir Robert’s wive’s eldest son.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="K. JOHN.">
  <li class="number">From henceforth bear his name whose form thou bearest:</li>
  <li class="number">Kneel thou down Philip, but rise more great,</li>
  <li class="number">Arise Sir Richard, and Plantagenet.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BAST.">
  <li class="number">Brother by th’ mother’s side, give me your hand;</li>
  <li class="number">My father gave me honor, yours gave land.</li>
  <li class="number">Now blessed be the hour by night or day</li>
  <li class="number">When I was got, Sir Robert was away!</li>
</ol>

  <li class="number">I am thy grandame, Richard, call me so.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BAST.">
  <li class="number">Madam, by chance, but not by truth; what though?</li>
  <li class="number">Something about, a little from the right,</li>
  <li class="number">In at the window, or else o’er the hatch.</li>
  <li class="number">Who dares not stir by day must walk by night,</li>
  <li class="number">And have is have, however men do catch.</li>
  <li class="number">Near or far off, well won is still well shot,</li>
  <li class="number">And I am I, howe’er I was begot.</li>

<ol data-speaker="K. JOHN.">
  <li class="number">Go, Faulconbridge, now hast thou thy desire,</li>
  <li class="number">A landless knight makes thee a landed squire.</li>
  <li class="number">Come, madam, and come, Richard, we must speed</li>
  <li class="number">For France, for France, for it is more than need.</li>

  <li class="number">A foot of honor better than I was,</li>

  <li class="number">Well, now can I make any Joan a lady.</li>
  <li class="number">“Good den, Sir Richard!” “God-a-mercy, fellow!”</li>
  <li class="number">And if his name be George, I’ll call him Peter;</li>
  <li class="number">For new-made honor doth forget men’s names;</li>

  <li class="number">My picked man of countries. “My dear sir,”</li>
  <li class="number">Thus, leaning on mine elbow, I begin,</li>
  <li class="number">“I shall beseech you”—that is question now;</li>

  <li class="number">At your employment, at your service, sir.”</li>
  <li class="number">“No, sir,” says question, “I, sweet sir, at yours”;</li>
  <li class="number">And so ere answer knows what question would,</li>
  <li class="number">Saving in dialogue of compliment,</li>
  <li class="number">And talking of the Alps and Apennines,</li>
  <li class="number">The Pyrenean and the river Po,</li>
  <li class="number">It draws toward supper in conclusion so.</li>
  <li class="number">But this is worshipful society,</li>
  <li class="number">And fits the mounting spirit like myself;</li>
  <li class="number">For he is but a bastard to the time</li>

  <li class="number">The latest breath that gave the sound of words</li>

  <li class="number">No longer than we well could wash our hands</li>

  <li class="number">Play fast and loose with faith? So jest with heaven?</li>
  <li class="number">Make such unconstant children of ourselves,</li>

  <li class="number">The better act of purposes mistook</li>

  <li class="number">It is religion that doth make vows kept,</li>

  <li class="number">To swear, swears only not to be forsworn,</li>

  <li class="number">Upon which better part our pray’rs come in,</li>
  <li class="number">If thou vouchsafe them. But if not, then know</li>

  <li class="number">Many a poor man’s son would have lien still,</li>

<h3>Scene 2</h3>

<h4>A room in King John’s castle.</h4>

<div class="stage-direction">
	Enter King John, Pembroke, Salisbury, and other Lords.
	
		K. JOHN.
		PEM.
		SAL.
		Lords
	
</div>

<ol data-speaker="K. JOHN.">
  <li class="number">Here once again we sit; once again crown’d,</li>
  <li class="number">And look’d upon, I hope, with cheerful eyes.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PEM.">
  <li class="number">This “once again” (but that your Highness pleas’d)</li>
  <li class="number">Was once superfluous. You were crown’d before,</li>
  <li class="number">And that high royalty was ne’er pluck’d off;</li>
  <li class="number">The faiths of men ne’er stained with revolt;</li>
  <li class="number">Fresh expectation troubled not the land</li>
  <li class="number">With any long’d-for change or better state.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SAL.">
  <li class="number">Therefore, to be possess’d with double pomp,</li>
  <li class="number">To guard a title that was rich before,</li>
  <li class="number">To gild refined gold, to paint the lily,</li>
  <li class="number">To throw a perfume on the violet,</li>
  <li class="number">To smooth the ice, or add another hue</li>
  <li class="number">Unto the rainbow, or with taper-light</li>
  <li class="number">To seek the beauteous eye of heaven to garnish,</li>
  <li class="number">Is wasteful and ridiculous excess.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PEM.">
  <li class="number">But that your royal pleasure must be done,</li>
  <li class="number">This act is as an ancient tale new told,</li>
  <li class="number">And, in the last repeating, troublesome,</li>
  <li class="number">Being urged at a time unseasonable.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SAL.">
  <li class="number">In this the antique and well-noted face</li>
  <li class="number">Of plain old form is much disfigured,</li>
  <li class="number">And like a shifted wind unto a sail,</li>
  <li class="number">It makes the course of thoughts to fetch about,</li>
  <li class="number">Startles and frights consideration,</li>
  <li class="number">Makes sound opinion sick, and truth suspected,</li>
  <li class="number">For putting on so new a fashion’d robe.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PEM.">
  <li class="number">When workmen strive to do better than well,</li>
  <li class="number">They do confound their skill in covetousness,</li>
  <li class="number">And oftentimes excusing of a fault</li>
  <li class="number">Doth make the fault the worse by th’ excuse:</li>
  <li class="number">As patches set upon a little breach</li>
  <li class="number">Discredit more in hiding of the fault</li>
  <li class="number">Than did the fault before it was so patch’d.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SAL.">
  <li class="number">To this effect, before you were new crown’d,</li>
  <li class="number">We breath’d our counsel; but it pleas’d your Highness</li>
  <li class="number">To overbear it, and we are all well pleas’d,</li>
  <li class="number">Since all and every part of what we would</li>
  <li class="number">Doth make a stand at what your Highness will.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="K. JOHN.">
  <li class="number">Some reasons of this double coronation</li>
  <li class="number">I have possess’d you with, and think them strong;</li>
  <li class="number">And more, more strong than lesser is my fear,</li>
  <li class="number">I shall indue you with. Mean time but ask</li>
  <li class="number">What you would have reform’d that is not well,</li>
  <li class="number">And well shall you perceive how willingly</li>
  <li class="number">I will both hear and grant you your requests.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PEM.">
  <li class="number">Then I, as one that am the tongue of these</li>
  <li class="number">To sound the purposes of all their hearts,</li>
  <li class="number">Both for myself and them—but, chief of all,</li>
  <li class="number">Your safety, for the which myself and them</li>
  <li class="number">Bend their best studies—heartily request</li>
  <li class="number">Th’ enfranchisement of Arthur, whose restraint</li>
  <li class="number">Doth move the murmuring lips of discontent</li>
  <li class="number">To break into this dangerous argument:</li>
  <li class="number">If what in rest you have in right you hold,</li>
  <li class="number">Why then your fears, which (as they say) attend</li>
  <li class="number">The steps of wrong, should move you to mew up</li>
  <li class="number">Your tender kinsman, and to choke his days</li>
  <li class="number">With barbarous ignorance, and deny his youth</li>
  <li class="number">The rich advantage of good exercise.</li>
  <li class="number">That the time’s enemies may not have this</li>
  <li class="number">To grace occasions, let it be our suit</li>
  <li class="number">That you have bid us ask his liberty,</li>
  <li class="number">Which for our goods we do no further ask</li>
  <li class="number">Than whereupon our weal, on you depending,</li>
  <li class="number">Counts it your weal he have his liberty.</li>

<ol data-speaker="PEM.">
  <li class="number">This is the man should do the bloody deed;</li>
  <li class="number">He show’d his warrant to a friend of mine.</li>
  <li class="number">The image of a wicked heinous fault</li>
  <li class="number">Lives in his eye; that close aspect of his</li>
  <li class="number">Doth show the mood of a much troubled breast,</li>
  <li class="number">And I do fearfully believe ’tis done,</li>
  <li class="number">What we so fear’d he had a charge to do.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SAL.">
  <li class="number">The color of the King doth come and go</li>
  <li class="number">Between his purpose and his conscience,</li>
  <li class="number">Like heralds ’twixt two dreadful battles set:</li>
  <li class="number">His passion is so ripe, it needs must break.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PEM.">
  <li class="number">And when it breaks, I fear will issue thence</li>
  <li class="number">The foul corruption of a sweet child’s death.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="K. JOHN.">
  <li class="number">We cannot hold mortality’s strong hand.</li>
  <li class="number">Good lords, although my will to give is living,</li>
  <li class="number">The suit which you demand is gone and dead.</li>
  <li class="number">He tells us Arthur is deceas’d tonight.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SAL.">
  <li class="number">Indeed we fear’d his sickness was past cure.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PEM.">
  <li class="number">Indeed we heard how near his death he was</li>
  <li class="number">Before the child himself felt he was sick.</li>
  <li class="number">This must be answer’d either here or hence.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="K. JOHN.">
  <li class="number">Why do you bend such solemn brows on me?</li>

  <li class="number">Have I commandment on the pulse of life?</li>

<ol data-speaker="SAL.">
  <li class="number">It is apparent foul play, and ’tis shame</li>
  <li class="number">That greatness should so grossly offer it.</li>
  <li class="number">So thrive it in your game! And so farewell.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PEM.">
  <li class="number">Stay yet, Lord Salisbury, I’ll go with thee,</li>
  <li class="number">And find th’ inheritance of this poor child,</li>
  <li class="number">His little kingdom of a forced grave.</li>
  <li class="number">That blood which ow’d the breadth of all this isle,</li>
  <li class="number">Three foot of it doth hold; bad world the while!</li>
  <li class="number">This must not be thus borne. This will break out</li>

  <li class="number">The sun of heaven, methought, was loath to set,</li>

  <li class="number">When English measure backward their own ground</li>

  <li class="number">When with a volley of our needless shot,</li>
  <li class="number">After such bloody toil, we bid good night,</li>
  <li class="number">And wound our tott’ring colors clearly up,</li>

  <li class="number">The Count Melune is slain; the English lords</li>

  <li class="number">Ah, foul shrewd news! Beshrew thy very heart!</li>
  <li class="number">I did not think to be so sad tonight</li>
  <li class="number">As this hath made me. Who was he that said</li>
  <li class="number">King John did fly an hour or two before</li>
  <li class="number">The stumbling night did part our weary pow’rs?</li>

  <li class="number">Who’s there? Speak ho! Speak quickly, or I shoot.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BAST.">
  <li class="number">A friend. What art thou?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HUB.">
  <li class="number">Of the part of England.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BAST.">
  <li class="number">Whither dost thou go?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HUB.">
  <li class="number">What’s that to thee? Why may not I demand</li>
  <li class="number">Of thine affairs, as well as thou of mine?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BAST.">
  <li class="number">Hubert, I think.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HUB.">
  <li class="number">Thou hast a perfect thought.</li>
  <li class="number">I will upon all hazards well believe</li>
  <li class="number">Thou art my friend that know’st my tongue so well.</li>
  <li class="number">Who art thou?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BAST.">
  <li class="number">Who thou wilt; and if thou please,</li>
  <li class="number">Thou mayst befriend me so much as to think</li>
  <li class="number">I come one way of the Plantagenets.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HUB.">
  <li class="number">Unkind remembrance! Thou and endless night</li>
  <li class="number">Have done me shame. Brave soldier, pardon me</li>
  <li class="number">That any accent breaking from thy tongue</li>
  <li class="number">Should scape the true acquaintance of mine ear.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BAST.">
  <li class="number">Come, come; sans compliment, what news abroad?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HUB.">
  <li class="number">Why, here walk I in the black brow of night,</li>
  <li class="number">To find you out.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BAST.">
  <li class="number">Brief then; and what’s the news?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HUB.">
  <li class="number">O my sweet sir, news fitting to the night,</li>
  <li class="number">Black, fearful, comfortless, and horrible.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BAST.">
  <li class="number">Show me the very wound of this ill news;</li>
  <li class="number">I am no woman, I’ll not swound at it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HUB.">
  <li class="number">The King, I fear, is poison’d by a monk.</li>
  <li class="number">I left him almost speechless, and broke out</li>
  <li class="number">To acquaint you with this evil, that you might</li>
  <li class="number">The better arm you to the sudden time</li>
  <li class="number">Than if you had at leisure known of this.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BAST.">
  <li class="number">How did he take it? Who did taste to him?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HUB.">
  <li class="number">A monk, I tell you, a resolved villain,</li>
  <li class="number">Whose bowels suddenly burst out. The King</li>
  <li class="number">Yet speaks, and peradventure may recover.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BAST.">
  <li class="number">Who didst thou leave to tend his Majesty?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HUB.">
  <li class="number">Why, know you not? The lords are all come back,</li>
  <li class="number">And brought Prince Henry in their company,</li>
  <li class="number">At whose request the King hath pardon’d them,</li>
  <li class="number">And they are all about his Majesty.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BAST.">
  <li class="number">Withhold thine indignation, mighty heaven,</li>
  <li class="number">And tempt us not to bear above our power!</li>
  <li class="number">I’ll tell thee, Hubert, half my power this night,</li>
  <li class="number">Passing these flats, are taken by the tide—</li>
  <li class="number">These Lincoln Washes have devoured them;</li>
  <li class="number">Myself, well mounted, hardly have escap’d.</li>

<h3>Scene 7</h3>

<h4>The orchard at Swinstead Abbey.</h4>

</div>

<ol data-speaker="P. HEN.">
  <li class="number">It is too late, the life of all his blood</li>
  <li class="number">Is touch’d corruptibly; and his pure brain</li>
  <li class="number">(Which some suppose the soul’s frail dwelling-house)</li>
  <li class="number">Doth by the idle comments that it makes</li>
  <li class="number">Foretell the ending of mortality.</li>

	Enter Pembroke.

</div>

<ol data-speaker="PEM.">
  <li class="number">His Highness yet doth speak, and holds belief</li>
  <li class="number">That being brought into the open air,</li>
  <li class="number">It would allay the burning quality</li>
  <li class="number">Of that fell poison which assaileth him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="P. HEN.">
  <li class="number">Let him be brought into the orchard here.</li>

  <li class="number">He is more patient</li>

<ol data-speaker="P. HEN.">
  <li class="number">O vanity of sickness! Fierce extremes</li>
  <li class="number">In their continuance will not feel themselves.</li>
  <li class="number">Death, having prey’d upon the outward parts,</li>
  <li class="number">Leaves them invisible, and his siege is now</li>
  <li class="number">Against the mind, the which he pricks and wounds</li>
  <li class="number">With many legions of strange fantasies,</li>
  <li class="number">Which in their throng and press to that last hold,</li>
  <li class="number">Confound themselves. ’Tis strange that death should sing.</li>
  <li class="number">I am the cygnet to this pale faint swan</li>
  <li class="number">Who chaunts a doleful hymn to his own death,</li>
  <li class="number">And from the organ-pipe of frailty sings</li>
  <li class="number">His soul and body to their lasting rest.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SAL.">
  <li class="number">Be of good comfort, Prince, for you are born</li>

  <li class="number">Ay, marry, now my soul hath elbow-room,</li>

  <li class="number">There is so hot a summer in my bosom</li>
  <li class="number">That all my bowels crumble up to dust.</li>
  <li class="number">I am a scribbled form, drawn with a pen</li>
  <li class="number">Upon a parchment, and against this fire</li>
  <li class="number">Do I shrink up.</li>

  <li class="number">How fares your Majesty?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="K. JOHN.">
  <li class="number">Poison’d—ill fare! Dead, forsook, cast off,</li>
  <li class="number">And none of you will bid the winter come</li>
  <li class="number">To thrust his icy fingers in my maw,</li>
  <li class="number">Nor let my kingdom’s rivers take their course</li>
  <li class="number">Through my burn’d bosom, nor entreat the north</li>
  <li class="number">To make his bleak winds kiss my parched lips</li>
  <li class="number">And comfort me with cold. I do not ask you much,</li>
  <li class="number">I beg cold comfort; and you are so strait</li>

  <li class="number">The salt in them is hot.</li>
  <li class="number">Within me is a hell, and there the poison</li>

  <li class="number">O cousin, thou art come to set mine eye.</li>
  <li class="number">The tackle of my heart is crack’d and burn’d,</li>

  <li class="number">Are turned to one thread, one little hair.</li>
  <li class="number">My heart hath one poor string to stay it by,</li>

  <li class="number">The Dauphin is preparing hitherward,</li>

  <li class="number">Even so must I run on, and even so stop.</li>

<ol data-speaker="BAST.">
  <li class="number">Art thou gone so? I do but stay behind</li>

  <li class="number">And then my soul shall wait on thee to heaven,</li>
  <li class="number">As it on earth hath been thy servant still.</li>
  <li class="number">Now, now, you stars, that move in your right spheres,</li>
  <li class="number">Where be your pow’rs? Show now your mended faiths,</li>
  <li class="number">And instantly return with me again</li>
  <li class="number">To push destruction and perpetual shame</li>
  <li class="number">Out of the weak door of our fainting land.</li>
  <li class="number">Straight let us seek, or straight we shall be sought;</li>
  <li class="number">The Dauphin rages at our very heels.</li>

<ol data-speaker="SAL.">
  <li class="number">It seems you know not then so much as we.</li>
  <li class="number">The Cardinal Pandulph is within at rest,</li>

<ol data-speaker="SAL.">
  <li class="number">Nay, ’tis in a manner done already,</li>
  <li class="number">For many carriages he hath dispatch’d</li>
  <li class="number">To the sea-side, and put his cause and quarrel</li>
  <li class="number">To the disposing of the Cardinal,</li>
  <li class="number">With whom yourself, myself, and other lords,</li>
  <li class="number">If you think meet, this afternoon will post</li>
  <li class="number">To consummate this business happily.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BAST.">
  <li class="number">Let it be so, and you, my noble Prince,</li>
  <li class="number">With other princes that may best be spar’d,</li>
  <li class="number">Shall wait upon your father’s funeral.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="P. HEN.">
  <li class="number">At Worcester must his body be interr’d,</li>

  <li class="number">The lineal state and glory of the land!</li>
  <li class="number">To whom with all submission, on my knee,</li>
  <li class="number">I do bequeath my faithful services</li>
  <li class="number">And true subjection everlastingly.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SAL.">
  <li class="number">And the like tender of our love we make,</li>
  <li class="number">To rest without a spot forevermore.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="P. HEN.">
  <li class="number">I have a kind soul that would give thanks,</li>
  <li class="number">And knows not how to do it but with tears.</li>

<ol data-speaker="BAST.">
  <li class="number">O, let us pay the time but needful woe,</li>
  <li class="number">Since it hath been beforehand with our griefs.</li>
  <li class="number">This England never did, nor never shall,</li>

  <li class="number">But when it first did help to wound itself.</li>
  <li class="number">Now these her princes are come home again,</li>
  <li class="number">Come the three corners of the world in arms,</li>
  <li class="number">And we shall shock them. Nought shall make us rue,</li>
