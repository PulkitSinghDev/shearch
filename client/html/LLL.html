<ol data-speaker="KING.">
  <li class="number">Let fame, that all hunt after in their lives,</li>
  <li class="number">Live regist’red upon our brazen tombs,</li>
  <li class="number">And then grace us in the disgrace of death;</li>
  <li class="number">When spite of cormorant devouring Time,</li>
  <li class="number">Th’ endeavor of this present breath may buy</li>
  <li class="number">That honor which shall bate his scythe’s keen edge,</li>
  <li class="number">And make us heirs of all eternity.</li>
  <li class="number">Therefore, brave conquerors—for so you are,</li>
  <li class="number">That war against your own affections</li>
  <li class="number">And the huge army of the world’s desires—</li>
  <li class="number">Our late edict shall strongly stand in force:</li>
  <li class="number">Navarre shall be the wonder of the world;</li>
  <li class="number">Our court shall be a little academe,</li>
  <li class="number">Still and contemplative in living art.</li>
  <li class="number">You three, Berowne, Dumaine, and Longaville,</li>
  <li class="number">Have sworn for three years’ term to live with me,</li>
  <li class="number">My fellow scholars, and to keep those statutes</li>
  <li class="number">That are recorded in this schedule here.</li>
  <li class="number">Your oaths are pass’d, and now subscribe your names,</li>
  <li class="number">That his own hand may strike his honor down</li>
  <li class="number">That violates the smallest branch herein.</li>
  <li class="number">If you are arm’d to do, as sworn to do,</li>
  <li class="number">Subscribe to your deep oaths, and keep it too.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LONG.">
  <li class="number">I am resolved, ’tis but a three years’ fast:</li>
  <li class="number">The mind shall banquet, though the body pine;</li>
  <li class="number">Fat paunches have lean pates; and dainty bits</li>
  <li class="number">Make rich the ribs, but bankrupt quite the wits.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUM.">
  <li class="number">My loving lord, Dumaine is mortified:</li>
  <li class="number">The grosser manner of these world’s delights</li>
  <li class="number">He throws upon the gross world’s baser slaves;</li>
  <li class="number">To love, to wealth, to pomp, I pine and die,</li>
  <li class="number">With all these living in philosophy.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BER.">
  <li class="number">I can but say their protestation over:</li>
  <li class="number">So much, dear liege, I have already sworn,</li>
  <li class="number">That is, to live and study here three years.</li>
  <li class="number">But there are other strict observances:</li>
  <li class="number">As not to see a woman in that term,</li>
  <li class="number">Which I hope well is not enrolled there;</li>
  <li class="number">And one day in a week to touch no food,</li>
  <li class="number">And but one meal on every day beside,</li>
  <li class="number">The which I hope is not enrolled there;</li>
  <li class="number">And then to sleep but three hours in the night,</li>
  <li class="number">And not be seen to wink of all the day—</li>
  <li class="number">When I was wont to think no harm all night,</li>
  <li class="number">And make a dark night too of half the day—</li>
  <li class="number">Which I hope well is not enrolled there.</li>
  <li class="number">O, these are barren tasks, too hard to keep,</li>
  <li class="number">Not to see ladies, study, fast, not sleep.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING.">
  <li class="number">Your oath is pass’d to pass away from these.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BER.">
  <li class="number">Let me say no, my liege, and if you please:</li>
  <li class="number">I only swore to study with your Grace,</li>
  <li class="number">And stay here in your court for three years’ space.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LONG.">
  <li class="number">You swore to that, Berowne, and to the rest.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BER.">
  <li class="number">By yea and nay, sir, then I swore in jest.</li>
  <li class="number">What is the end of study, let me know.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING.">
  <li class="number">Why, that to know which else we should not know.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BER.">
  <li class="number">Things hid and barr’d (you mean) from common sense.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING.">
  <li class="number">Ay, that is study’s godlike recompense.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BER.">
  <li class="number">Com’ on then, I will swear to study so,</li>
  <li class="number">To know the thing I am forbid to know:</li>
  <li class="number">As thus—to study where I well may dine,</li>
  <li class="number">When I to feast expressly am forbid;</li>
  <li class="number">Or study where to meet some mistress fine,</li>
  <li class="number">When mistresses from common sense are hid;</li>
  <li class="number">Or having sworn too hard-a-keeping oath,</li>
  <li class="number">Study to break it and not break my troth.</li>
  <li class="number">If study’s gain be thus, and this be so,</li>
  <li class="number">Study knows that which yet it doth not know.</li>
  <li class="number">Swear me to this, and I will ne’er say no.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING.">
  <li class="number">These be the stops that hinder study quite,</li>
  <li class="number">And train our intellects to vain delight.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BER.">
  <li class="number">Why? All delights are vain, but that most vain</li>
  <li class="number">Which, with pain purchas’d, doth inherit pain:</li>
  <li class="number">As, painfully to pore upon a book</li>
  <li class="number">To seek the light of truth, while truth the while</li>
  <li class="number">Doth falsely blind the eyesight of his look.</li>
  <li class="number">Light, seeking light, doth light of light beguile;</li>
  <li class="number">So ere you find where light in darkness lies,</li>
  <li class="number">Your light grows dark by losing of your eyes.</li>
  <li class="number">Study me how to please the eye indeed</li>
  <li class="number">By fixing it upon a fairer eye,</li>
  <li class="number">Who dazzling so, that eye shall be his heed,</li>
  <li class="number">And give him light that it was blinded by.</li>
  <li class="number">Study is like the heaven’s glorious sun,</li>
  <li class="number">That will not be deep search’d with saucy looks;</li>
  <li class="number">Small have continual plodders ever won,</li>
  <li class="number">Save base authority from others’ books.</li>
  <li class="number">These earthly godfathers of heaven’s lights,</li>
  <li class="number">That give a name to every fixed star,</li>
  <li class="number">Have no more profit of their shining nights</li>
  <li class="number">Than those that walk and wot not what they are.</li>
  <li class="number">Too much to know is to know nought but fame;</li>
  <li class="number">And every godfather can give a name.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING.">
  <li class="number">How well he’s read, to reason against reading!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUM.">
  <li class="number">Proceeded well, to stop all good proceeding!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LONG.">
  <li class="number">He weeds the corn and still lets grow the weeding.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BER.">
  <li class="number">The spring is near when green geese are a-breeding.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUM.">
  <li class="number">How follows that?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BER.">
  <li class="number">Fit in his place and time.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUM.">
  <li class="number">In reason nothing.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BER.">
  <li class="number">Something then in rhyme.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING.">
  <li class="number">Berowne is like an envious sneaping frost</li>
  <li class="number">That bites the first-born infants of the spring.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BER.">
  <li class="number">Well, say I am, why should proud summer boast</li>
  <li class="number">Before the birds have any cause to sing?</li>
  <li class="number">Why should I joy in any abortive birth?</li>
  <li class="number">At <date type="holiday" subtype="Christian">Christmas</date> I no more desire a rose</li>
  <li class="number">Than wish a snow in May’s new-fangled shows;</li>
  <li class="number">But like of each thing that in season grows.</li>
  <li class="number">So you, to study now it is too late,</li>
  <li class="number">Climb o’er the house to unlock the little gate.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING.">
  <li class="number">Well, sit you out; go home, Berowne; <foreign xml:lang="fr">adieu</foreign>.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BER.">
  <li class="number">No, my good lord, I have sworn to stay with you;</li>
  <li class="number">And though I have for barbarism spoke more</li>
  <li class="number">Than for that angel knowledge you can say,</li>
  <li class="number">Yet, confident, I’ll keep what I have sworn,</li>
  <li class="number">And bide the penance of each three years’ day.</li>
  <li class="number">Give me the paper, let me read the same,</li>
  <li class="number">And to the strictest decrees I’ll write my name.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING.">
  <li class="number">How well this yielding rescues thee from shame!</li>

  <li class="number">To fright them hence with that dread penalty.</li>

  <li class="number">This article, my liege, yourself must break,</li>
  <li class="number">For well you know here comes in embassy</li>
  <li class="number">The French king’s daughter with yourself to speak—</li>
  <li class="number">A maid of grace and complete majesty—</li>
  <li class="number">About surrender up of Aquitaine</li>
  <li class="number">To her decrepit, sick, and bedred father;</li>
  <li class="number">Therefore this article is made in vain,</li>
  <li class="number">Or vainly comes th’ admired Princess hither.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING.">
  <li class="number">What say you, lords? Why, this was quite forgot.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BER.">
  <li class="number">So study evermore is overshot:</li>
  <li class="number">While it doth study to have what it would,</li>
  <li class="number">It doth forget to do the thing it should;</li>
  <li class="number">And when it hath the thing it hunteth most,</li>
  <li class="number">’Tis won as towns with fire—so won, so lost.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING.">
  <li class="number">We must of force dispense with this decree,</li>
  <li class="number">She must lie here on mere necessity.</li>

<ol data-speaker="BER.">
  <li class="number">Necessity will make us all forsworn</li>
  <li class="number">Three thousand times within this three years’ space;</li>
  <li class="number">For every man with his affects is born,</li>
  <li class="number">Not by might mast’red, but by special grace.</li>
  <li class="number">If I break faith, this word shall speak for me:</li>
  <li class="number">I am forsworn “on mere necessity.”</li>

  <li class="number">And he that breaks them in the least degree</li>
  <li class="number">Stands in attainder of eternal shame.</li>
  <li class="number">Suggestions are to other as to me;</li>
  <li class="number">But I believe, although I seem so loath,</li>
  <li class="number">I am the last that will last keep his oath.</li>
  <li class="number">But is there no quick recreation granted?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING.">
  <li class="number">Ay, that there is. Our court you know is haunted</li>
  <li class="number">With a refined traveler of Spain,</li>
  <li class="number">A man in all the world’s new fashion planted,</li>
  <li class="number">That hath a mint of phrases in his brain;</li>
  <li class="number">One who the music of his own vain tongue</li>
  <li class="number">Doth ravish like enchanting harmony;</li>
  <li class="number">A man of complements, whom right and wrong</li>
  <li class="number">Have chose as umpeer of their mutiny.</li>
  <li class="number">This child of fancy, that Armado hight,</li>
  <li class="number">For interim to our studies shall relate,</li>
  <li class="number">In high-borne words, the worth of many a knight</li>
  <li class="number">From tawny Spain, lost in the world’s debate.</li>
  <li class="number">How you delight, my lords, I know not, I,</li>
  <li class="number">But I protest I love to hear him lie,</li>
  <li class="number">And I will use him for my minstrelsy.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BER.">
  <li class="number">Armado is a most illustrious wight,</li>

  <li class="number">A great sign, sir, that he will look sad.</li>

<ol data-speaker="ARM.">
  <li class="number">Why, sadness is one and the self-same thing, dear imp.</li>

<ol data-speaker="ARM.">
  <li class="number">I spoke it tender juvenal as a congruent epitheton appertaining to thy young days, which we may nominate tender.</li>

<ol data-speaker="MOTH.">
  <li class="number">And I tough <foreign xml:lang="it">signior</foreign> as an appertinent title to your old time, which we may name tough.</li>

  <li class="number">I do say thou art quick in answers; thou heat’st my blood.</li>

  <li class="number">I have promised to study three years with the Duke.</li>

  <li class="number">You may do it in an hour, sir.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ARM.">
  <li class="number">Impossible.</li>

<ol data-speaker="ARM.">
  <li class="number">I am ill at reck’ning, it fitteth the spirit of a tapster.</li>

<ol data-speaker="MOTH.">
  <li class="number">You are a gentleman and a gamester, sir.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ARM.">
  <li class="number">I confess both, they are both the varnish of a complete man.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOTH.">
  <li class="number">Then I am sure you know how much the gross sum of deuce-ace amounts to.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ARM.">
  <li class="number">It doth amount to one more than two.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOTH.">
  <li class="number">Which the base vulgar do call three.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ARM.">
  <li class="number">True.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOTH.">
  <li class="number">Why, sir, is this such a piece of study? Now here is three studied ere ye’ll thrice wink; and how easy it is to put “years” to the word “three,” and study three years in two words, the dancing horse will tell you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ARM.">

</li>
  <li class="number"> To prove you a cipher.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ARM.">
  <li class="number">I will hereupon confess I am in love; and as it is base for a soldier to love, so am I in love with a base wench. If drawing my sword against the humor of affection would deliver me from the reprobate thought of it, I would take Desire prisoner, and ransom him to any French courtier for a new devis’d cur’sy. I think scorn to sigh; methinks I should outswear Cupid. Comfort me, boy: what great men have been in love?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOTH.">
  <li class="number">Hercules, master.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ARM.">
  <li class="number">Most sweet Hercules! More authority, dear boy, name more; and, sweet my child, let them be men of good repute and carriage.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOTH.">
  <li class="number">Sampson, master; he was a man of good carriage, great carriage, for he carried the town gates on his back like a porter; and he was in love.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ARM.">
  <li class="number">O well-knit Sampson, strong-jointed Sampson! I do excel thee in my rapier as much as thou didst me in carrying gates. I am in love too. Who was Sampson’s love, my dear Moth?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOTH.">
  <li class="number">A woman, master.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ARM.">
  <li class="number">Of what complexion?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOTH.">
  <li class="number">Of all the four, or the three, or the two, or one of the four.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ARM.">
  <li class="number">Tell me precisely of what complexion.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOTH.">
  <li class="number">Of the sea-water green, sir.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ARM.">
  <li class="number">Is that one of the four complexions?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOTH.">
  <li class="number">As I have read, sir, and the best of them too.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ARM.">
  <li class="number">Green indeed is the color of lovers; but to have a love of that color, methinks Sampson had small reason for it. He surely affected her for her wit.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOTH.">
  <li class="number">It was so, sir, for she had a green wit.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ARM.">
  <li class="number">My love is most immaculate white and red.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOTH.">
  <li class="number">Most maculate thoughts, master, are mask’d under such colors.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ARM.">
  <li class="number">Define, define, well-educated infant.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOTH.">
  <li class="number">My father’s wit and my mother’s tongue assist me!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ARM.">
  <li class="number">Sweet invocation of a child, most pretty and pathetical!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOTH.">
  <li class="number"><recite>If she be made of white and red,</recite></li>
  <li class="number"><recite>Her faults will ne’er be known,</recite></li>
  <li class="number"><recite>For blush in cheeks by faults are bred,</recite></li>
  <li class="number"><recite>And fears by pale white shown:</recite></li>
  <li class="number"><recite>Then if she fear, or be to blame,</recite></li>
  <li class="number"><recite>By this you shall not know,</recite></li>
  <li class="number"><recite>For still her cheeks possess the same</recite></li>
  <li class="number"><recite>Which native she doth owe.</recite></li>
  <li class="number">A dangerous rhyme, master, against the reason of white and red.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ARM.">
  <li class="number">Is there not a ballet, boy, of the <name type="title">King and the Beggar</name>?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOTH.">
  <li class="number">The world was very guilty of such a ballet some three ages since, but I think now ’tis not to be found; or if it were, it would neither serve for the writing nor the tune.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ARM.">
  <li class="number">I will have that subject newly writ o’er, that I may example my digression by some mighty president. Boy, I do love that country girl that I took in the park with the rational hind Costard. She deserves well.</li>

Love is a familiar; Love is a devil; there is no evil angel but Love. Yet was Sampson so tempted, and he had an excellent strength; yet was Salomon so seduced, and he had a very good wit.

  <li class="number">No, my complete master, but to jig off a tune at the tongue’s end, canary to it with your feet, humor it with turning up your eyelids, sigh a note and sing a note, sometime through the throat, as if you swallow’d love with singing love, sometime through the nose, as if you snuff’d up love by smelling love; with your hat penthouse-like o’er the shop of your eyes; with your arms cross’d on your thin-bellied doublet like a rabbit on a spit; or your hands in your pocket like a man after the old painting; and keep not too long in one tune, but a snip and away: these are complements, these are humors, these betray nice wenches that would be betray’d without these; and make them men of note—do you note?—men that most are affected to these.</li>

The conclusion is victory; on whose side? The king’s. The captive is enrich’d; on whose side? The beggar’s. The catastrophe is a nuptial; on whose side? The king’s; no, on both in one, or one in both. I am the king, for so stands the comparison; thou the beggar, for so witnesseth thy lowliness. Shall I command thy love? I may. Shall I enforce thy love? I could. Shall I entreat thy love? I will. What shalt thou exchange for rags? Robes; for tittles? Titles; for thyself? Me.

<ol data-speaker="BER.">
  <li class="number">O, ’tis more than need.</li>
  <li class="number">Have at you then, affection’s men-at-arms.</li>
  <li class="number">Consider what you first did swear unto:</li>
  <li class="number">To fast, to study, and to see no woman—</li>
  <li class="number">Flat treason ’gainst the kingly state of youth.</li>
  <li class="number">Say, can you fast? Your stomachs are too young,</li>
  <li class="number">And abstinence engenders maladies.</li>
  <li class="number">(And where that you have vow’d to study, lords,</li>
  <li class="number">In that each of you have forsworn his book,</li>
  <li class="number">Can you still dream and pore and thereon look?</li>
  <li class="number">For when would you, my lord, or you, or you,</li>
  <li class="number">Have found the ground of study’s excellence</li>
  <li class="number">Without the beauty of a woman’s face?</li>
  <li class="number">From women’s eyes this doctrine I derive:</li>
  <li class="number">They are the ground, the books, the academes,</li>
  <li class="number">From whence doth spring the true Promethean fire.</li>
  <li class="number">Why, universal plodding poisons up</li>
  <li class="number">The nimble spirits in the arteries,</li>
  <li class="number">As motion and long-during action tires</li>
  <li class="number">The sinowy vigor of the traveler.</li>
  <li class="number">Now for not looking on a woman’s face,</li>
  <li class="number">You have in that forsworn the use of eyes,</li>
  <li class="number">And study too, the causer of your vow.</li>
  <li class="number">For where is any author in the world</li>
  <li class="number">Teaches such beauty as a woman’s eye?</li>
  <li class="number">Learning is but an adjunct to ourself,</li>
  <li class="number">And where we are, our learning likewise is.</li>
  <li class="number">Then when ourselves we see in ladies’ eyes,</li>
  <li class="number">With ourselves,</li>
  <li class="number">Do we not likewise see our learning there?)</li>
  <li class="number">O, we have made a vow to study, lords,</li>
  <li class="number">And in that vow we have forsworn our books.</li>
  <li class="number">For when would you, my liege, or you, or you,</li>
  <li class="number">In leaden contemplation have found out</li>
  <li class="number">Such fiery numbers as the prompting eyes</li>
  <li class="number">Of beauty’s tutors have enrich’d you with?</li>
  <li class="number">Other slow arts entirely keep the brain;</li>
  <li class="number">And therefore, finding barren practicers,</li>
  <li class="number">Scarce show a harvest of their heavy toil;</li>
  <li class="number">But love, first learned in a lady’s eyes,</li>
  <li class="number">Lives not alone immured in the brain,</li>
  <li class="number">But with the motion of all elements,</li>
  <li class="number">Courses as swift as thought in every power,</li>
  <li class="number">And gives to every power a double power,</li>
  <li class="number">Above their functions and their offices.</li>
  <li class="number">It adds a precious seeing to the eye:</li>
  <li class="number">A lover’s eyes will gaze an eagle blind.</li>
  <li class="number">A lover’s ear will hear the lowest sound,</li>
  <li class="number">When the suspicious head of theft is stopp’d.</li>
  <li class="number">Love’s feeling is more soft and sensible</li>
  <li class="number">Than are the tender horns of cockled snails.</li>
  <li class="number">Love’s tongue proves dainty Bacchus gross in taste.</li>
  <li class="number">For valor, is not Love a Hercules,</li>
  <li class="number">Still climbing trees in the Hesperides?</li>
  <li class="number">Subtile as Sphinx, as sweet and musical</li>
  <li class="number">As bright Apollo’s lute, strung with his hair.</li>
  <li class="number">And when Love speaks, the voice of all the gods</li>
  <li class="number">Make heaven drowsy with the harmony.</li>
  <li class="number">Never durst poet touch a pen to write</li>
  <li class="number">Until his ink were temp’red with Love’s sighs:</li>
  <li class="number">O then his lines would ravish savage ears</li>
  <li class="number">And plant in tyrants mild humility.</li>
  <li class="number">From women’s eyes this doctrine I derive:</li>
  <li class="number">They sparkle still the right Promethean fire;</li>
  <li class="number">They are the books, the arts, the academes,</li>
  <li class="number">That show, contain, and nourish all the world,</li>
  <li class="number">Else none at all in aught proves excellent.</li>
  <li class="number">Then fools you were these women to forswear,</li>
  <li class="number">Or keeping what is sworn, you will prove fools.</li>
  <li class="number">For wisdom’s sake, a word that all men love,</li>
  <li class="number">Or for love’s sake, a word that loves all men,</li>
  <li class="number">Or for men’s sake, the authors of these women,</li>
  <li class="number">Or women’s sake, by whom we men are men,</li>
  <li class="number">Let us once lose our oaths to find ourselves,</li>
  <li class="number">Or else we lose ourselves to keep our oaths.</li>
  <li class="number">It is religion to be thus forsworn:</li>
  <li class="number">For charity itself fulfills the law,</li>
  <li class="number">And who can sever love from charity?</li>

  <li class="number">The posterior of the day, most generous sir, is liable, congruent, and measurable for the afternoon. The word is well cull’d, chose, sweet, and apt, I do assure you, sir, I do assure.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ARM.">
  <li class="number">Sir, the King is a noble gentleman, and my familiar, I do assure ye, very good friend; for what is inward between us, let it pass. I do beseech thee remember thy courtesy; I beseech thee apparel thy head; and among other importunate and most serious designs, and of great import indeed too—but let that pass; for I must tell thee it will please his Grace (by the world) sometime to lean upon my poor shoulder, and with his royal finger, thus, dally with my excrement, with my mustachio; but, sweet heart, let that pass. By the world, I recount no fable: some certain special honors it pleaseth his greatness to impart to Armado, a soldier, a man of travel, that hath seen the world; but let that pass. The very all of all is—but, sweet heart, I do implore secrety—that the King would have me present the Princess (sweet chuck) with some delightful ostentation, or show, or pageant, or antic, or firework. Now, understanding that the curate and your sweet self are good at such eruptions and sudden breaking out of mirth (as it were), I have acquainted you withal, to the end to crave your assistance.</li>

<ol data-speaker="HOL.">
  <li class="number">Sir, you shall present before her the Nine Worthies. Sir Nathaniel, as concerning some entertainment of time, some show in the posterior of this day, to be rend’red by our assistance, the King’s command, and this most gallant, illustrate, and learned gentleman, before the Princess, I say none so fit as to present the Nine Worthies.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NATH.">
  <li class="number">Where will you find men worthy enough to present them?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HOL.">
  <li class="number">Joshua, yourself; myself; and this gallant gentleman, Judas Machabeus; this swain (because of his great limb or joint) shall pass Pompey the Great; the page, Hercules.</li>

<ol data-speaker="ARM.">
  <li class="number">Pardon, sir, error: he is not quantity enough for that Worthy’s thumb, he is not so big as the end of his club.</li>

<ol data-speaker="HOL.">
  <li class="number">Shall I have audience? He shall present Hercules in minority; his enter and exit shall be strangling a snake; and I will have an apology for that purpose.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MOTH.">
  <li class="number">An excellent device! So if any of the audience hiss, you may cry, “Well done, Hercules, now thou crushest the snake!” That is the way to make an offense gracious, though few have the grace to do it.</li>

<h4>The King of Navarre’s park.</h4>

<div class="stage-direction">
	Enter the Ladies: the Princess, Maria, Katherine, and Rosaline.
	
		PRIN.

		ROS.
	
</div>

<ol data-speaker="PRIN.">
  <li class="number">Sweet hearts, we shall be rich ere we depart,</li>
  <li class="number">If fairings come thus plentifully in.</li>
  <li class="number">A lady wall’d about with diamonds!</li>
  <li class="number">Look you what I have from the loving King.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROS.">
  <li class="number">Madam, came nothing else along with that?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRIN.">
  <li class="number">Nothing but this? Yes, as much love in rhyme</li>
  <li class="number">As would be cramm’d up in a sheet of paper,</li>
  <li class="number">Writ a’ both sides the leaf, margent and all,</li>
  <li class="number">That he was fain to seal on Cupid’s name.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROS.">
  <li class="number">That was the way to make his godhead wax,</li>
  <li class="number">For he hath been five thousand year a boy.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KATH.">
  <li class="number">Ay, and a shrewd unhappy gallows too.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROS.">
  <li class="number">You’ll ne’er be friends with him, ’a kill’d your sister.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KATH.">
  <li class="number">He made her melancholy, sad, and heavy,</li>
  <li class="number">And so she died. Had she been light, like you,</li>
  <li class="number">Of such a merry, nimble, stirring spirit,</li>
  <li class="number">She might ’a’ been a grandam ere she died.</li>
  <li class="number">And so may you; for a light heart lives long.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROS.">
  <li class="number">What’s your dark meaning, mouse, of this light word?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KATH.">
  <li class="number">A light condition in a beauty dark.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROS.">
  <li class="number">We need more light to find your meaning out.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KATH.">
  <li class="number">You’ll mar the light by taking it in snuff;</li>
  <li class="number">Therefore I’ll darkly end the argument.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROS.">
  <li class="number">Look what you do, you do it still i’ th’ dark.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KATH.">
  <li class="number">So do not you, for you are a light wench.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROS.">
  <li class="number">Indeed I weigh not you, and therefore light.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KATH.">
  <li class="number">You weigh me not? O, that’s you care not for me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROS.">
  <li class="number">Great reason: for past care is still past cure.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRIN.">
  <li class="number">Well bandied both, a set of wit well played.</li>
  <li class="number">But, Rosaline, you have a favor too?</li>
  <li class="number">Who sent it? And what is it?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROS.">
  <li class="number">I would you knew.</li>
  <li class="number">And if my face were but as fair as yours,</li>
  <li class="number">My favor were as great: be witness this.</li>
  <li class="number">Nay, I have verses too, I thank Berowne;</li>
  <li class="number">The numbers true, and, were the numb’ring too,</li>
  <li class="number">I were the fairest goddess on the ground.</li>
  <li class="number">I am compar’d to twenty thousand fairs.</li>
  <li class="number">O, he hath drawn my picture in his letter!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRIN.">
  <li class="number">Any thing like?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROS.">
  <li class="number">Much in the letters, nothing in the praise.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRIN.">
  <li class="number">Beauteous as ink—a good conclusion.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KATH.">
  <li class="number">Fair as a text B in a copy-book.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROS.">
  <li class="number">Ware pencils ho! Let me not die your debtor,</li>
  <li class="number">My red dominical, my golden letter:</li>
  <li class="number">O that your face were not so full of o’s!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRIN.">
  <li class="number">A pox of that jest! And I beshrew all shrews.</li>
  <li class="number">But, Katherine, what was sent to you from fair Dumaine?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KATH.">
  <li class="number">Madam, this glove.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRIN.">
  <li class="number">Did he not send you twain?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KATH.">
  <li class="number">Yes, madam, and moreover</li>
  <li class="number">Some thousand verses of a faithful lover.</li>
  <li class="number">A huge translation of hypocrisy,</li>
  <li class="number">Vildly compiled, profound simplicity.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MAR.">
  <li class="number">This, and these pearls, to me sent Longaville.</li>
  <li class="number">The letter is too long by half a mile.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRIN.">
  <li class="number">I think no less. Dost thou not wish in heart</li>
  <li class="number">The chain were longer and the letter short?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MAR.">
  <li class="number">Ay, or I would these hands might never part.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRIN.">
  <li class="number">We are wise girls to mock our lovers so.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROS.">
  <li class="number">They are worse fools to purchase mocking so.</li>
  <li class="number">That same Berowne I’ll torture ere I go.</li>
  <li class="number">O that I knew he were but in by th’ week!</li>
  <li class="number">How I would make him fawn, and beg, and seek,</li>
  <li class="number">And wait the season, and observe the times,</li>
  <li class="number">And spend his prodigal wits in bootless rhymes,</li>
  <li class="number">And shape his service wholly to my device,</li>
  <li class="number">And make him proud to make me proud that jests!</li>
  <li class="number">So pair-taunt-like would I o’ersway his state</li>
  <li class="number">That he should be my fool and I his fate.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRIN.">
  <li class="number">None are so surely caught, when they are catch’d,</li>
  <li class="number">As wit turn’d fool; folly, in wisdom hatch’d,</li>
  <li class="number">Hath wisdom’s warrant and the help of school,</li>
  <li class="number">And wit’s own grace to grace a learned fool.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROS.">
  <li class="number">The blood of youth burns not with such excess</li>
  <li class="number">As gravity’s revolt to wantonness.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MAR.">
  <li class="number">Folly in fools bears not so strong a note</li>
  <li class="number">As fool’ry in the wise, when wit doth dote,</li>
  <li class="number">Since all the power thereof it doth apply</li>
  <li class="number">To prove, by wit, worth in simplicity.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">
	Enter Boyet.
	
		BOYET.
	
</div>

<ol data-speaker="PRIN.">
  <li class="number">Here comes Boyet, and mirth is in his face.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BOYET.">
  <li class="number">O, I am stabb’d with laughter! Where’s her Grace?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRIN.">
  <li class="number">Thy news, Boyet?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BOYET.">
  <li class="number">Prepare, madam, prepare!</li>
  <li class="number">Arm, wenches, arm! Encounters mounted are</li>
  <li class="number">Against your peace. Love doth approach disguis’d,</li>
  <li class="number">Armed in arguments—You’ll be surpris’d.</li>
  <li class="number">Muster your wits, stand in your own defense,</li>
  <li class="number">Or hide your heads like cowards, and fly hence.</li>

<ol data-speaker="PRIN.">
  <li class="number">Saint Denis to Saint Cupid! What are they</li>
  <li class="number">That charge their breath against us? Say, scout, say.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BOYET.">
  <li class="number">Under the cool shade of a sycamore</li>
  <li class="number">I thought to close mine eyes some half an hour;</li>
  <li class="number">When lo, to interrupt my purpos’d rest,</li>
  <li class="number">Toward that shade I might behold address’d</li>
  <li class="number">The King and his companions. Warily</li>
  <li class="number">I stole into a neighbor thicket by,</li>
  <li class="number">And overheard what you shall overhear:</li>
  <li class="number">That by and by disguis’d they will be here.</li>
  <li class="number">Their herald is a pretty knavish page,</li>
  <li class="number">That well by heart hath conn’d his embassage.</li>
  <li class="number">Action and accent did they teach him there:</li>
  <li class="number">“Thus must thou speak,” and “thus thy body bear”;</li>
  <li class="number">And ever and anon they made a doubt</li>
  <li class="number">Presence majestical would put him out;</li>
  <li class="number">“For,” quoth the King, “an angel shalt thou see;</li>
  <li class="number">Yet fear not thou, but speak audaciously.”</li>
  <li class="number">The boy replied, “An angel is not evil;</li>
  <li class="number">I should have fear’d her had she been a devil.”</li>
  <li class="number">With that all laugh’d, and clapp’d him on the shoulder,</li>
  <li class="number">Making the bold wag by their praises bolder.</li>
  <li class="number">One rubb’d his elbow thus, and fleer’d, and swore</li>
  <li class="number">A better speech was never spoke before.</li>
  <li class="number">Another, with his finger and his thumb,</li>
  <li class="number">Cried, “Via! We will do’t, come what will come.”</li>
  <li class="number">The third he caper’d, and cried, “All goes well.”</li>
  <li class="number">The fourth turn’d on the toe, and down he fell.</li>
  <li class="number">With that they all did tumble on the ground,</li>
  <li class="number">With such a zealous laughter, so profound,</li>
  <li class="number">That in this spleen ridiculous appears,</li>
  <li class="number">To check their folly, passion’s solemn tears.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRIN.">
  <li class="number">But what, but what, come they to visit us?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BOYET.">
  <li class="number">They do, they do; and are apparell’d thus,</li>
  <li class="number">Like Muscovites or Russians, as I guess.</li>
  <li class="number">Their purpose is to parley, to court, and dance,</li>
  <li class="number">And every one his love-feat will advance</li>
  <li class="number">Unto his several mistress, which they’ll know</li>
  <li class="number">By favors several which they did bestow.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRIN.">
  <li class="number">And will they so? The gallants shall be task’d:</li>
  <li class="number">For, ladies, we will every one be mask’d,</li>
  <li class="number">And not a man of them shall have the grace,</li>
  <li class="number">Despite of suit, to see a lady’s face.</li>
  <li class="number">Hold, Rosaline, this favor thou shalt wear,</li>
  <li class="number">And then the King will court thee for his dear.</li>
  <li class="number">Hold, take thou this, my sweet, and give me thine,</li>
  <li class="number">So shall Berowne take me for Rosaline.</li>
  <li class="number">And change you favors too, so shall your loves</li>
  <li class="number">Woo contrary, deceiv’d by these removes.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROS.">
  <li class="number">Come on then, wear the favors most in sight.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KATH.">
  <li class="number">But in this changing, what is your intent?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRIN.">
  <li class="number">The effect of my intent is to cross theirs:</li>
  <li class="number">They do it but in mockery merriment,</li>
  <li class="number">And mock for mock is only my intent.</li>
  <li class="number">Their several counsels they unbosom shall</li>
  <li class="number">To loves mistook, and so be mock’d withal</li>
  <li class="number">Upon the next occasion that we meet,</li>
  <li class="number">With visages display’d, to talk and greet.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROS.">
  <li class="number">But shall we dance, if they desire us to’t?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRIN.">
  <li class="number">No, to the death we will not move a foot,</li>
  <li class="number">Nor to their penn’d speech render we no grace,</li>
  <li class="number">But while ’tis spoke each turn away her face.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BOYET.">
  <li class="number">Why, that contempt will kill the speaker’s heart,</li>
  <li class="number">And quite divorce his memory from his part.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRIN.">
  <li class="number">Therefore I do it, and I make no doubt</li>
  <li class="number">The rest will ne’er come in, if he be out.</li>
  <li class="number">There’s no such sport as sport by sport o’erthrown,</li>
  <li class="number">To make theirs ours and ours none but our own;</li>
  <li class="number">So shall we stay, mocking intended game,</li>
  <li class="number">And they, well mock’d, depart away with shame.</li>

  <li class="number">The liberal opposition of our spirits,</li>

<ol data-speaker="KING.">
  <li class="number">The extreme parts of time extremely forms</li>

  <li class="number">Forbid the smiling courtesy of love</li>
  <li class="number">The holy suit which fain it would convince,</li>
  <li class="number">Yet since love’s argument was first on foot,</li>
  <li class="number">Let not the cloud of sorrow justle it</li>

  <li class="number">Honest plain words best pierce the ear of grief,</li>
  <li class="number">And by these badges understand the King.</li>
  <li class="number">For your fair sakes have we neglected time,</li>
  <li class="number">Play’d foul play with our oaths. Your beauty, ladies,</li>
  <li class="number">Hath much deformed us, fashioning our humors</li>
  <li class="number">Even to the opposed end of our intents;</li>
  <li class="number">And what in us hath seem’d ridiculous—</li>
  <li class="number">As love is full of unbefitting strains,</li>
  <li class="number">All wanton as a child, skipping and vain,</li>
  <li class="number">Form’d by the eye and therefore like the eye,</li>
  <li class="number">Full of straying shapes, of habits, and of forms,</li>
  <li class="number">Varying in subjects as the eye doth roll</li>
  <li class="number">To every varied object in his glance;</li>
  <li class="number">Which parti-coated presence of loose love</li>
  <li class="number">Put on by us, if, in your heavenly eyes,</li>
  <li class="number">Have misbecom’d our oaths and gravities,</li>
  <li class="number">Those heavenly eyes, that look into these faults,</li>
  <li class="number">Suggested us to make. Therefore, ladies,</li>
  <li class="number">Our love being yours, the error that love makes</li>
  <li class="number">Is likewise yours. We to ourselves prove false,</li>
  <li class="number">By being once false forever to be true</li>
  <li class="number">To those that make us both—fair ladies, you;</li>

  <li class="number">If for my love (as there is no such cause)</li>
  <li class="number">You will do aught, this shall you do for me:</li>
  <li class="number">Your oath I will not trust, but go with speed</li>

  <li class="number">There stay until the twelve celestial signs</li>

  <li class="number">If this austere insociable life</li>
  <li class="number">Change not your offer made in heat of blood;</li>
  <li class="number">If frosts and fasts, hard lodging and thin weeds</li>
  <li class="number">Nip not the gaudy blossoms of your love</li>

  <li class="number">Then at the expiration of the year,</li>
  <li class="number">Come challenge me, challenge me by these deserts,</li>
  <li class="number">And by this virgin palm now kissing thine,</li>
  <li class="number">I will be thine; and till that instant shut</li>
  <li class="number">My woeful self up in a mourning house,</li>
  <li class="number">Raining the tears of lamentation</li>
  <li class="number">For the remembrance of my father’s death.</li>

<ol data-speaker="KING.">
  <li class="number">If this, or more than this, I would deny,</li>

<ol data-speaker="ROS.">
  <li class="number">Oft have I heard of you, my Lord Berowne,</li>

  <li class="number">Full of comparisons and wounding flouts,</li>
  <li class="number">Which you on all estates will execute</li>
  <li class="number">That lie within the mercy of your wit.</li>
  <li class="number">To weed this wormwood from your fructful brain,</li>
  <li class="number">And therewithal to win me, if you please,</li>
  <li class="number">Without the which I am not to be won,</li>
  <li class="number">You shall this twelvemonth term from day to day</li>

  <li class="number">To move wild laughter in the throat of death?</li>

  <li class="number">A jest’s prosperity lies in the ear</li>
