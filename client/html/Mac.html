Whiles I stood rapt in the wonder of it, came missives from the King, who all-hail’d me “Thane of Cawdor,” by which title, before, these weird sisters saluted me, and referr’d me to the coming on of time with “Hail, King that shalt be!” This have I thought good to deliver thee, my dearest partner of greatness, that thou mightst not lose the dues of rejoicing by being ignorant of what greatness is promis’d thee. Lay it to thy heart, and farewell.”</recite></li>

<ol data-speaker="MAL.">
  <li class="number">Let us seek out some desolate shade, and there</li>
  <li class="number">Weep our sad bosoms empty.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MACD.">
  <li class="number">Let us rather</li>
  <li class="number">Hold fast the mortal sword, and like good men</li>
  <li class="number">Bestride our downfall birthdom. Each new morn</li>
  <li class="number">New widows howl, new orphans cry, new sorrows</li>
  <li class="number">Strike heaven on the face, that it resounds</li>
  <li class="number">As if it felt with Scotland, and yell’d out</li>
  <li class="number">Like syllable of dolor.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MAL.">
  <li class="number">What I believe, I’ll wail,</li>
  <li class="number">What know, believe; and what I can redress,</li>
  <li class="number">As I shall find the time to friend, I will.</li>
  <li class="number">What you have spoke, it may be so perchance.</li>
  <li class="number">This tyrant, whose sole name blisters our tongues,</li>
  <li class="number">Was once thought honest; you have lov’d him well;</li>
  <li class="number">He hath not touch’d you yet. I am young, but something</li>
  <li class="number">You may discern of him through me, and wisdom</li>
  <li class="number">To offer up a weak, poor, innocent lamb</li>
  <li class="number">T’ appease an angry god.</li>
</ol>

  <li class="number">I am not treacherous.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MAL.">
  <li class="number">But Macbeth is.</li>
  <li class="number">A good and virtuous nature may recoil</li>
  <li class="number">In an imperial charge. But I shall crave your pardon;</li>
  <li class="number">That which you are, my thoughts cannot transpose:</li>
  <li class="number">Angels are bright still, though the brightest fell.</li>
  <li class="number">Though all things foul would wear the brows of grace,</li>
  <li class="number">Yet grace must still look so.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MACD.">
  <li class="number">I have lost my hopes.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MAL.">
  <li class="number">Perchance even there where I did find my doubts.</li>
  <li class="number">Why in that rawness left you wife and child,</li>
  <li class="number">Those precious motives, those strong knots of love,</li>
  <li class="number">Without leave-taking? I pray you,</li>
  <li class="number">Let not my jealousies be your dishonors,</li>
  <li class="number">But mine own safeties. You may be rightly just,</li>
  <li class="number">What ever I shall think.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MACD.">
  <li class="number">Bleed, bleed, poor country!</li>
  <li class="number">Great tyranny, lay thou thy basis sure,</li>
  <li class="number">For goodness dare not check thee; wear thou thy wrongs,</li>
  <li class="number">The title is affeer’d! Fare thee well, lord,</li>
  <li class="number">I would not be the villain that thou think’st</li>
  <li class="number">For the whole space that’s in the tyrant’s grasp,</li>
  <li class="number">And the rich East to boot.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MAL.">
  <li class="number">Be not offended;</li>
  <li class="number">I speak not as in absolute fear of you.</li>
  <li class="number">I think our country sinks beneath the yoke:</li>
  <li class="number">It weeps, it bleeds, and each new day a gash</li>
  <li class="number">Is added to her wounds. I think withal</li>
  <li class="number">There would be hands uplifted in my right;</li>
  <li class="number">And here from gracious England have I offer</li>
  <li class="number">Of goodly thousands. But, for all this,</li>
  <li class="number">When I shall tread upon the tyrant’s head,</li>
  <li class="number">Or wear it on my sword, yet my poor country</li>
  <li class="number">Shall have more vices than it had before,</li>
  <li class="number">More suffer, and more sundry ways than ever,</li>
  <li class="number">By him that shall succeed.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MACD.">
  <li class="number">What should he be?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MAL.">
  <li class="number">It is myself I mean; in whom I know</li>
  <li class="number">All the particulars of vice so grafted</li>
  <li class="number">That, when they shall be open’d, black Macbeth</li>
  <li class="number">Will seem as pure as snow, and the poor state</li>
  <li class="number">Esteem him as a lamb, being compar’d</li>
  <li class="number">With my confineless harms.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MACD.">
  <li class="number">Not in the legions</li>
  <li class="number">Of horrid hell can come a devil more damn’d</li>
  <li class="number">In evils to top Macbeth.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MAL.">
  <li class="number">I grant him bloody,</li>
  <li class="number">Luxurious, avaricious, false, deceitful,</li>
  <li class="number">Sudden, malicious, smacking of every sin</li>
  <li class="number">That has a name; but there’s no bottom, none,</li>
  <li class="number">In my voluptuousness. Your wives, your daughters,</li>
  <li class="number">Your matrons, and your maids could not fill up</li>
  <li class="number">The cistern of my lust, and my desire</li>
  <li class="number">All continent impediments would o’erbear</li>
  <li class="number">That did oppose my will. Better Macbeth</li>
  <li class="number">Than such an one to reign.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MACD.">
  <li class="number">Boundless intemperance</li>
  <li class="number">In nature is a tyranny; it hath been</li>
  <li class="number">Th’ untimely emptying of the happy throne,</li>
  <li class="number">And fall of many kings. But fear not yet</li>
  <li class="number">To take upon you what is yours. You may</li>
  <li class="number">Convey your pleasures in a spacious plenty,</li>
  <li class="number">And yet seem cold, the time you may so hoodwink.</li>
  <li class="number">We have willing dames enough; there cannot be</li>
  <li class="number">That vulture in you to devour so many</li>
  <li class="number">As will to greatness dedicate themselves,</li>
  <li class="number">Finding it so inclin’d.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MAL.">
  <li class="number">With this, there grows</li>
  <li class="number">In my most ill-compos’d affection such</li>
  <li class="number">A stanchless avarice that, were I king,</li>
  <li class="number">I should cut off the nobles for their lands,</li>
  <li class="number">Desire his jewels, and this other’s house,</li>
  <li class="number">And my more-having would be as a sauce</li>
  <li class="number">To make me hunger more, that I should forge</li>
  <li class="number">Quarrels unjust against the good and loyal,</li>
  <li class="number">Destroying them for wealth.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MACD.">
  <li class="number">This avarice</li>
  <li class="number">Sticks deeper, grows with more pernicious root</li>
  <li class="number">Than summer-seeming lust; and it hath been</li>
  <li class="number">The sword of our slain kings. Yet do not fear,</li>
  <li class="number">Scotland hath foisons to fill up your will</li>
  <li class="number">Of your mere own. All these are portable,</li>
  <li class="number">With other graces weigh’d.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MAL.">
  <li class="number">But I have none. The king-becoming graces,</li>
  <li class="number">As justice, verity, temp’rance, stableness,</li>
  <li class="number">Bounty, perseverance, mercy, lowliness,</li>
  <li class="number">Devotion, patience, courage, fortitude,</li>
  <li class="number">I have no relish of them, but abound</li>
  <li class="number">In the division of each several crime,</li>
  <li class="number">Acting it many ways. Nay, had I pow’r, I should</li>
  <li class="number">Pour the sweet milk of concord into hell,</li>
  <li class="number">Uproar the universal peace, confound</li>
  <li class="number">All unity on earth.</li>
</ol>

  <li class="number">O Scotland, Scotland!</li>

  <li class="number">I am as I have spoken.</li>

<ol data-speaker="MACD.">
  <li class="number">Fit to govern?</li>
  <li class="number">No, not to live. O nation miserable!</li>
  <li class="number">With an untitled tyrant bloody-sceptred,</li>
  <li class="number">When shalt thou see thy wholesome days again,</li>
  <li class="number">Since that the truest issue of thy throne</li>
  <li class="number">By his own interdiction stands accus’d,</li>
  <li class="number">And does blaspheme his breed? Thy royal father</li>
  <li class="number">Was a most sainted king; the queen that bore thee,</li>
  <li class="number">Oft’ner upon her knees than on her feet,</li>
  <li class="number">Died every day she liv’d. Fare thee well,</li>
  <li class="number">These evils thou repeat’st upon thyself</li>
  <li class="number">Hath banish’d me from Scotland. O my breast,</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MAL.">
  <li class="number">Macduff, this noble passion,</li>
  <li class="number">Child of integrity, hath from my soul</li>
  <li class="number">Wip’d the black scruples, reconcil’d my thoughts</li>
  <li class="number">To thy good truth and honor. Devilish Macbeth</li>
  <li class="number">By many of these trains hath sought to win me</li>
  <li class="number">Into his power, and modest wisdom plucks me</li>
  <li class="number">From over-credulous haste. But God above</li>
  <li class="number">Deal between thee and me! For even now</li>
  <li class="number">I put myself to thy direction, and</li>
  <li class="number">Unspeak mine own detraction; here abjure</li>
  <li class="number">The taints and blames I laid upon myself,</li>
  <li class="number">For strangers to my nature. I am yet</li>
  <li class="number">Unknown to woman, never was forsworn,</li>
  <li class="number">Scarcely have coveted what was mine own,</li>
  <li class="number">At no time broke my faith, would not betray</li>
  <li class="number">The devil to his fellow, and delight</li>
  <li class="number">No less in truth than life. My first false speaking</li>
  <li class="number">Was this upon myself. What I am truly</li>
  <li class="number">Is thine and my poor country’s to command:</li>
  <li class="number">Whither indeed, before thy here-approach,</li>
  <li class="number">Old Siward, with ten thousand warlike men</li>
  <li class="number">Already at a point, was setting forth.</li>
