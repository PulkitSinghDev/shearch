<ol data-speaker="EGE.">
  <li class="number">Proceed, Solinus, to procure my fall,</li>
  <li class="number">And by the doom of death end woes and all.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE.">
  <li class="number">Merchant of Syracuse, plead no more.</li>
  <li class="number">I am not partial to infringe our laws;</li>
  <li class="number">The enmity and discord which of late</li>
  <li class="number">Sprung from the rancorous outrage of your Duke</li>
  <li class="number">To merchants, our well-dealing countrymen,</li>
  <li class="number">Who, wanting guilders to redeem their lives,</li>
  <li class="number">Have seal’d his rigorous statutes with their bloods,</li>
  <li class="number">Excludes all pity from our threat’ning looks:</li>
  <li class="number">For since the mortal and intestine jars</li>
  <li class="number">’Twixt thy seditious countrymen and us,</li>
  <li class="number">It hath in solemn synods been decreed,</li>
  <li class="number">Both by the Syracusians and ourselves,</li>
  <li class="number">To admit no traffic to our adverse towns:</li>
  <li class="number">Nay more, if any born at Ephesus be seen</li>
  <li class="number">At any Syracusian marts and fairs;</li>
  <li class="number">Again, if any Syracusian born</li>
  <li class="number">Come to the bay of Ephesus, he dies,</li>
  <li class="number">His goods confiscate to the Duke’s dispose,</li>
  <li class="number">Unless a thousand marks be levied</li>
  <li class="number">To quit the penalty and to ransom him.</li>
  <li class="number">Thy substance, valued at the highest rate,</li>
  <li class="number">Cannot amount unto a hundred marks,</li>
  <li class="number">Therefore by law thou art condemn’d to die.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="EGE.">
  <li class="number">Yet this my comfort, when your words are done,</li>
  <li class="number">My woes end likewise with the evening sun.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE.">
  <li class="number">Well, Syracusian; say in brief the cause</li>
  <li class="number">Why thou departedst from thy native home,</li>
  <li class="number">And for what cause thou cam’st to Ephesus.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="EGE.">
  <li class="number">A heavier task could not have been impos’d</li>
  <li class="number">Than I to speak my griefs unspeakable:</li>
  <li class="number">Yet that the world may witness that my end</li>
  <li class="number">Was wrought by nature, not by vile offense,</li>
  <li class="number">I’ll utter what my sorrow gives me leave.</li>
  <li class="number">In Syracuse was I born, and wed</li>
  <li class="number">Unto a woman, happy but for me,</li>
  <li class="number">And by me, had not our hap been bad:</li>
  <li class="number">With her I liv’d in joy; our wealth increas’d</li>
  <li class="number">By prosperous voyages I often made</li>
  <li class="number">To Epidamium, till my factor’s death,</li>
  <li class="number">And the great care of goods at random left,</li>
  <li class="number">Drew me from kind embracements of my spouse;</li>
  <li class="number">From whom my absence was not six months old</li>
  <li class="number">Before herself (almost at fainting under</li>
  <li class="number">The pleasing punishment that women bear)</li>
  <li class="number">Had made provision for her following me,</li>
  <li class="number">And soon, and safe, arrived where I was.</li>
  <li class="number">There had she not been long but she became</li>
  <li class="number">A joyful mother of two goodly sons:</li>
  <li class="number">And, which was strange, the one so like the other</li>
  <li class="number">As could not be distinguish’d but by names.</li>
  <li class="number">That very hour, and in the self-same inn,</li>
  <li class="number">A mean woman was delivered</li>
  <li class="number">Of such a burden male, twins both alike.</li>
  <li class="number">Those, for their parents were exceeding poor,</li>
  <li class="number">I bought, and brought up to attend my sons.</li>
  <li class="number">My wife, not meanly proud of two such boys,</li>
  <li class="number">Made daily motions for our home return:</li>
  <li class="number">Unwilling I agreed. Alas! Too soon</li>
  <li class="number">We came aboard.</li>
  <li class="number">A league from Epidamium had we sail’d</li>
  <li class="number">Before the always-wind-obeying deep</li>
  <li class="number">Gave any tragic instance of our harm:</li>
  <li class="number">But longer did we not retain much hope;</li>
  <li class="number">For what obscured light the heavens did grant</li>
  <li class="number">Did but convey unto our fearful minds</li>
  <li class="number">A doubtful warrant of immediate death,</li>
  <li class="number">Which though myself would gladly have embrac’d,</li>
  <li class="number">Yet the incessant weepings of my wife,</li>
  <li class="number">Weeping before for what she saw must come,</li>
  <li class="number">And piteous plainings of the pretty babes,</li>
  <li class="number">That mourn’d for fashion, ignorant what to fear,</li>
  <li class="number">Forc’d me to seek delays for them and me.</li>
  <li class="number">And this it was (for other means was none):</li>
  <li class="number">The sailors sought for safety by our boat,</li>
  <li class="number">And left the ship, then sinking-ripe, to us.</li>
  <li class="number">My wife, more careful for the latter-born,</li>
  <li class="number">Had fast’ned him unto a small spare mast,</li>
  <li class="number">Such as sea-faring men provide for storms;</li>
  <li class="number">To him one of the other twins was bound,</li>
  <li class="number">Whilst I had been like heedful of the other.</li>
  <li class="number">The children thus dispos’d, my wife and I,</li>
  <li class="number">Fixing our eyes on whom our care was fix’d,</li>
  <li class="number">Fast’ned ourselves at either end the mast,</li>
  <li class="number">And floating straight, obedient to the stream,</li>
  <li class="number">Was carried towards Corinth, as we thought.</li>
  <li class="number">At length the sun, gazing upon the earth,</li>
  <li class="number">Dispers’d those vapors that offended us,</li>
  <li class="number">And by the benefit of his wished light</li>
  <li class="number">The seas wax’d calm, and we discovered</li>
  <li class="number">Two ships from far, making amain to us,</li>
  <li class="number">Of Corinth that, of Epidaurus this.</li>
  <li class="number">But ere they came—O, let me say no more!</li>
  <li class="number">Gather the sequel by that went before.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE.">
  <li class="number">Nay, forward, old man, do not break off so,</li>
  <li class="number">For we may pity, though not pardon thee.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="EGE.">
  <li class="number">O, had the gods done so, I had not now</li>
  <li class="number">Worthily term’d them merciless to us!</li>
  <li class="number">For ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues,</li>
  <li class="number">We were encount’red by a mighty rock,</li>
  <li class="number">Which being violently borne upon,</li>
  <li class="number">Our helpful ship was splitted in the midst;</li>
  <li class="number">So that, in this unjust divorce of us,</li>
  <li class="number">Fortune had left to both of us alike</li>
  <li class="number">What to delight in, what to sorrow for.</li>
  <li class="number">Her part, poor soul! Seeming as burdened</li>
  <li class="number">With lesser weight, but not with lesser woe,</li>
  <li class="number">Was carried with more speed before the wind,</li>
  <li class="number">And in our sight they three were taken up</li>
  <li class="number">By fishermen of Corinth, as we thought.</li>
  <li class="number">At length, another ship had seiz’d on us,</li>
  <li class="number">And knowing whom it was their hap to save,</li>
  <li class="number">Gave healthful welcome to their shipwrack’d guests,</li>
  <li class="number">And would have reft the fishers of their prey,</li>
  <li class="number">Had not their bark been very slow of sail;</li>
  <li class="number">And therefore homeward did they bend their course.</li>
  <li class="number">Thus have you heard me sever’d from my bliss,</li>
  <li class="number">That by misfortunes was my life prolong’d,</li>
  <li class="number">To tell sad stories of my own mishaps.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE.">
  <li class="number">And for the sake of them thou sorrowest for,</li>
  <li class="number">Do me the favor to dilate at full</li>
  <li class="number">What have befall’n of them and thee till now.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="EGE.">
  <li class="number">My youngest boy, and yet my eldest care,</li>
  <li class="number">At eighteen years became inquisitive</li>
  <li class="number">After his brother; and importun’d me</li>
  <li class="number">That his attendant—so his case was like,</li>
  <li class="number">Reft of his brother, but retain’d his name—</li>
  <li class="number">Might bear him company in the quest of him:</li>
  <li class="number">Whom whilst I labored of a love to see,</li>
  <li class="number">I hazarded the loss of whom I lov’d.</li>
  <li class="number">Five summers have I spent in farthest Greece,</li>
  <li class="number">Roaming clean through the bounds of Asia,</li>
  <li class="number">And coasting homeward, came to Ephesus;</li>
  <li class="number">Hopeless to find, yet loath to leave unsought</li>
  <li class="number">Or that, or any place that harbors men.</li>
  <li class="number">But here must end the story of my life,</li>
  <li class="number">And happy were I in my timely death,</li>
  <li class="number">Could all my travels warrant me they live.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE.">
  <li class="number">Hapless Egeon, whom the fates have mark’d</li>
  <li class="number">To bear the extremity of dire mishap!</li>
  <li class="number">Now trust me, were it not against our laws,</li>
  <li class="number">Against my crown, my oath, my dignity,</li>
  <li class="number">Which princes, would they, may not disannul,</li>
  <li class="number">My soul should sue as advocate for thee:</li>
  <li class="number">But though thou art adjudged to the death,</li>
  <li class="number">And passed sentence may not be recall’d</li>
  <li class="number">But to our honor’s great disparagement,</li>
  <li class="number">Yet will I favor thee in what I can;</li>
  <li class="number">Therefore, merchant, I’ll limit thee this day</li>

  <li class="number">Try all the friends thou hast in Ephesus;</li>

  <li class="number">Return’d so soon! Rather approach’d too late:</li>

  <li class="number">You know no Centaur? You receiv’d no gold?</li>

  <li class="number">What answer, sir? When spake I such a word?</li>

<ol data-speaker="S. ANT.">
  <li class="number">Even now, even here, not half an hour since.</li>

<ol data-speaker="S. DRO.">

<ol data-speaker="S. DRO.">
  <li class="number">Hold, sir, for God’s sake! Now your jest is earnest,</li>
  <li class="number">Upon what bargain do you give it me?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="S. ANT.">
  <li class="number">Because that I familiarly sometimes</li>
  <li class="number">Do use you for my fool, and chat with you,</li>
  <li class="number">Your sauciness will jest upon my love,</li>
  <li class="number">And make a common of my serious hours.</li>
  <li class="number">When the sun shines, let foolish gnats make sport,</li>

<ol data-speaker="S. DRO.">
  <li class="number">Sconce call you it? So you would leave battering, I had rather have it a head. And you use these blows long, I must get a sconce for my head, and ensconce it too, or else I shall seek my wit in my shoulders. But I pray, sir, why am I beaten?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="S. ANT.">
  <li class="number">Dost thou not know?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="S. DRO.">
  <li class="number">Nothing, sir, but that I am beaten.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="S. ANT.">
  <li class="number">Shall I tell you why?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="S. DRO.">
  <li class="number">Ay, sir, and wherefore; for they say, every why hath a wherefore.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="S. ANT.">
  <li class="number">Why first—for flouting me, and then wherefore—</li>
  <li class="number">For urging it the second time to me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="S. DRO.">
  <li class="number">Was there ever any man thus beaten out of season,</li>

  <li class="number">Thank me, sir, for what?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="S. DRO.">
  <li class="number">Marry, sir, for this something that you gave me for nothing.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="S. ANT.">
  <li class="number">I’ll make you amends next, to give you nothing for something. But say, sir, is it dinner-time?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="S. DRO.">
  <li class="number">No, sir, I think the meat wants that I have.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="S. ANT.">
  <li class="number">In good time, sir: what’s that?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="S. DRO.">
  <li class="number">Basting.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="S. ANT.">
  <li class="number">Well, sir, then ’twill be dry.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="S. DRO.">
  <li class="number">If it be, sir, I pray you eat none of it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="S. ANT.">
  <li class="number">Your reason?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="S. DRO.">
  <li class="number">Lest it make you choleric, and purchase me another dry basting.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="S. ANT.">
  <li class="number">Well, sir, learn to jest in good time—there’s a time for all things.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="S. DRO.">
  <li class="number">I durst have denied that before you were so choleric.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="S. ANT.">
  <li class="number">By what rule, sir?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="S. DRO.">
  <li class="number">Marry, sir, by a rule as plain as the plain bald pate of Father Time himself.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="S. ANT.">
  <li class="number">Let’s hear it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="S. DRO.">
  <li class="number">There’s no time for a man to recover his hair that grows bald by nature.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="S. ANT.">
  <li class="number">May he not do it by fine and recovery?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="S. DRO.">
  <li class="number">Yes, to pay a fine for a periwig, and recover the lost hair of another man.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="S. ANT.">
  <li class="number">Why is Time such a niggard of hair, being (as it is) so plentiful an excrement?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="S. DRO.">
  <li class="number">Because it is a blessing that he bestows on beasts, and what he hath scanted men in hair he hath given them in wit.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="S. ANT.">
  <li class="number">Why, but there’s many a man hath more hair than wit.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="S. DRO.">
  <li class="number">Not a man of those but he hath the wit to lose his hair.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="S. ANT.">
  <li class="number">Why, thou didst conclude hairy men plain dealers without wit.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="S. DRO.">
  <li class="number">The plainer dealer, the sooner lost; yet he loseth it in a kind of jollity.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="S. ANT.">
  <li class="number">For what reason?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="S. DRO.">
  <li class="number">For two—and sound ones too.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="S. ANT.">
  <li class="number">Nay, not sound, I pray you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="S. DRO.">
  <li class="number">Sure ones then.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="S. ANT.">
  <li class="number">Nay, not sure, in a thing falsing.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="S. DRO.">
  <li class="number">Certain ones then.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="S. ANT.">
  <li class="number">Name them.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="S. DRO.">
  <li class="number">The one, to save the money that he spends in tiring; the other, that at dinner they should not drop in his porridge.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="S. ANT.">
  <li class="number">You would all this time have prov’d there is no time for all things.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="S. DRO.">
  <li class="number">Marry, and did, sir: namely, e’en no time to recover hair lost by nature.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="S. ANT.">
  <li class="number">But your reason was not substantial, why there is no time to recover.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="S. DRO.">
  <li class="number">Thus I mend it: Time himself is bald, and therefore, to the world’s end, will have bald followers.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="S. ANT.">
  <li class="number">I knew ’twould be a bald conclusion. But soft, who wafts us yonder?</li>

  <li class="number">Shall love, in building, grow so ruinous?</li>
  <li class="number">If you did wed my sister for her wealth,</li>
  <li class="number">Then for her wealth’s sake use her with more kindness:</li>
  <li class="number">Or if you like elsewhere, do it by stealth,</li>
  <li class="number">Muffle your false love with some show of blindness:</li>
  <li class="number">Let not my sister read it in your eye;</li>
  <li class="number">Be not thy tongue thy own shame’s orator:</li>

  <li class="number">Shame hath a bastard fame, well managed;</li>
  <li class="number">Ill deeds is doubled with an evil word.</li>
  <li class="number">Alas, poor women, make us but believe</li>
