  <li class="number">We are three queens, whose sovereigns fell before</li>
  <li class="number">The wrath of cruel Creon; who endured</li>
  <li class="number">The beaks of ravens, talents of the kites,</li>
  <li class="number">And pecks of crows in the foul fields of Thebes.</li>
  <li class="number">He will not suffer us to bum their bones,</li>

  <li class="number">Of mortal loathsomeness from the blest eye</li>
  <li class="number">Of holy Phoebus, but infects the winds</li>
  <li class="number">With stench of our slain lords. O, pity, Duke,</li>
  <li class="number">Thou purger of the earth, draw thy fear’d sword</li>
  <li class="number">That does good turns to th’ world; give us the bones</li>
  <li class="number">Of our dead kings, that we may chapel them;</li>
  <li class="number">And of thy boundless goodness take some note</li>
  <li class="number">That for our crowned heads we have no roof,</li>
  <li class="number">Save this which is the lion’s, and the bear’s,</li>
  <li class="number">And vault to every thing!</li>

<ol data-speaker="THE.">
  <li class="number">Pray you kneel not;</li>
  <li class="number">I was transported with your speech, and suffer’d</li>
  <li class="number">Your knees to wrong themselves. I have heard the fortunes</li>
  <li class="number">Of your dead lords, which gives me such lamenting</li>
  <li class="number">As wakes my vengeance and revenge for ’em.</li>
  <li class="number">King Capaneus was your lord. The day</li>
  <li class="number">That he should marry you, at such a season</li>
  <li class="number">As now it is with me, I met your groom</li>
  <li class="number">By Mars’s altar. You were that time fair;</li>
  <li class="number">Not Juno’s mantle fairer than your tresses,</li>
  <li class="number">Nor in more bounty spread her. Your wheaten wreath</li>
  <li class="number">Was then nor thresh’d nor blasted; Fortune at you</li>
  <li class="number">Dimpled her cheek with smiles. Hercules our kinsman</li>
  <li class="number">(Then weaker than your eyes) laid by his club;</li>
  <li class="number">He tumbled down upon his Nemean hide,</li>
  <li class="number">And swore his sinews thaw’d. O grief and time,</li>
  <li class="number">Fearful consumers, you will all devour!</li>

<ol data-speaker="1. QUEEN.">
  <li class="number">O, I hope some god,</li>

  <li class="number">Honored Hippolyta,</li>

  <li class="number">The scythe-tusk’d boar; that with thy arm, as strong</li>
  <li class="number">As it is white, wast near to make the male</li>
  <li class="number">To thy sex captive, but that this thy lord,</li>
  <li class="number">Born to uphold creation in that honor</li>
  <li class="number">First Nature styl’d it in, shrunk thee into</li>
  <li class="number">The bound thou wast o’erflowing, at once subduing</li>
  <li class="number">Thy force and thy affection; soldieress</li>
  <li class="number">That equally canst poise sternness with pity,</li>
  <li class="number">Whom now I know hast much more power on him</li>
  <li class="number">Than ever he had on thee, who ow’st his strength,</li>
  <li class="number">And his love too, who is a servant for</li>
  <li class="number">The tenor of thy speech; dear glass of ladies,</li>
  <li class="number">Bid him that we, whom flaming war doth scorch,</li>

  <li class="number">Lend us a knee;</li>
  <li class="number">But touch the ground for us no longer time</li>

  <li class="number">Tell him, if he i’ th’ blood-siz’d field lay swoll’n,</li>

  <li class="number">You may behold ’em. Lady, lady, alack!</li>
  <li class="number">He that will all the treasure know o’ th’ earth</li>

  <li class="number">For my least minnow, let him lead his line</li>
  <li class="number">To catch one at my heart. O, pardon me,</li>

  <li class="number">Such heart-pierc’d demonstration! But alas,</li>
  <li class="number">Being a natural sister of our sex,</li>
  <li class="number">Your sorrow beats so ardently upon me</li>
  <li class="number">That it shall make a counter-reflect ’gainst</li>

<ol data-speaker="1. QUEEN.">
  <li class="number">O, this celebration</li>
  <li class="number">Will long last and be more costly than</li>
  <li class="number">Your suppliants’ war! Remember that your fame</li>
  <li class="number">Knolls in the ear o’ th’ world; what you do quickly</li>
  <li class="number">Is not done rashly; your first thought is more</li>
  <li class="number">Than others’ labored meditance; your premeditating</li>
  <li class="number">More than their actions. But, O Jove, your actions,</li>
  <li class="number">Soon as they move, as asprays do the fish,</li>
  <li class="number">Subdue before they touch. Think, dear Duke, think</li>
  <li class="number">What beds our slain kings have!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="2. QUEEN.">
  <li class="number">What griefs our beds</li>
  <li class="number">That our dear lords have none!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="3. QUEEN.">
  <li class="number">None fit for th’ dead:</li>
  <li class="number">Those that with cords, knives, drams, precipitance,</li>
  <li class="number">Weary of this world’s light, have to themselves</li>
  <li class="number">Been death’s most horrid agents, humane grace</li>
  <li class="number">Affords them dust and shadow.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. QUEEN.">
  <li class="number">But our lords</li>
  <li class="number">Lie blist’ring ’fore the visitating sun,</li>
  <li class="number">And were good kings when living.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="THE.">
  <li class="number">It is true; and I will give you comfort</li>
  <li class="number">To give your dead lords graves; the which to do</li>
  <li class="number">Must make some work with Creon.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. QUEEN.">
  <li class="number">And that work presents itself to th’ doing:</li>

<ol data-speaker="THE.">
  <li class="number">Why, good ladies,</li>

<ol data-speaker="ARC.">
  <li class="number">Dear Palamon, dearer in love than blood,</li>
  <li class="number">And our prime cousin, yet unhard’ned in</li>
  <li class="number">The crimes of nature—let us leave the city</li>
  <li class="number">Thebes, and the temptings in’t, before we further</li>
  <li class="number">Sully our gloss of youth:</li>
  <li class="number">And here to keep in abstinence we shame</li>
  <li class="number">As in incontinence; for not to swim</li>
  <li class="number">I’ th’ aid o’ th’ current were almost to sink,</li>
  <li class="number">At least to frustrate striving, and to follow</li>
  <li class="number">The common stream, ’twould bring us to an eddy</li>
  <li class="number">Where we should turn or drown; if labor through,</li>
  <li class="number">Our gain but life and weakness.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAL.">
  <li class="number">Your advice</li>
  <li class="number">Is cried up with example. What strange ruins,</li>
  <li class="number">Since first we went to school, may we perceive</li>
  <li class="number">Walking in Thebes! Scars and bare weeds</li>
  <li class="number">The gain o’ th’ martialist, who did propound</li>
  <li class="number">To his bold ends honor and golden ingots,</li>
  <li class="number">Which though he won, he had not; and now flurted</li>
  <li class="number">By peace, for whom he fought, who then shall offer</li>
  <li class="number">To Mars’s so scorn’d altar? I do bleed</li>
  <li class="number">When such I meet, and wish great Juno would</li>
  <li class="number">Resume her ancient fit of jealousy</li>
  <li class="number">To get the soldier work, that peace might purge</li>
  <li class="number">For her repletion, and retain anew</li>
  <li class="number">Her charitable heart, now hard, and harsher</li>
  <li class="number">Than strife or war could be.</li>

<ol data-speaker="ARC.">
  <li class="number">Are you not out?</li>
  <li class="number">Meet you no ruin but the soldier in</li>
  <li class="number">The cranks and turns of Thebes? You did begin</li>
  <li class="number">As if you met decays of many kinds.</li>
  <li class="number">Perceive you none that do arouse your pity</li>
  <li class="number">But th’ unconsider’d soldier?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAL.">
  <li class="number">Yes, I pity</li>
  <li class="number">Decays where e’er I find them, but such most</li>

<ol data-speaker="ARC.">
  <li class="number">’Tis not this</li>

They eat well, look merrily, discourse of many things, but nothing of their own restraint and disasters.

<h4>The prison.</h4>

<div class="stage-direction">
	Enter Palamon, and Arcite in prison.

</div>

<ol data-speaker="PAL.">
  <li class="number">How do you, noble cousin?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ARC.">
  <li class="number">How do you, sir?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAL.">
  <li class="number">Why, strong enough to laugh at misery</li>
  <li class="number">And bear the chance of war yet. We are prisoners</li>
  <li class="number">I fear forever, cousin.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ARC.">
  <li class="number">I believe it,</li>
  <li class="number">And to that destiny have patiently</li>
  <li class="number">Laid up my hour to come.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAL.">
  <li class="number">O cousin Arcite,</li>
  <li class="number">Where is Thebes now? Where is our noble country?</li>
  <li class="number">Where are our friends and kindreds? Never more</li>
  <li class="number">Must we behold those comforts, never see</li>
  <li class="number">The hardy youths strive for the games of honor,</li>
  <li class="number">Hung with the painted favors of their ladies,</li>
  <li class="number">Like tall ships under sail; then start amongst ’em</li>
  <li class="number">And as an east wind leave ’em all behind us,</li>
  <li class="number">Like lazy clouds, whilst Palamon and Arcite,</li>
  <li class="number">Even in the wagging of a wanton leg,</li>
  <li class="number">Outstripp’d the people’s praises, won the garlands,</li>
  <li class="number">Ere they have time to wish ’em ours. O, never</li>
  <li class="number">Shall we two exercise, like twins of honor,</li>
  <li class="number">Our arms again, and feel our fiery horses</li>
  <li class="number">Like proud seas under us. Our good swords now</li>
  <li class="number">(Better the red-ey’d god of war nev’r ware),</li>
  <li class="number">Ravish’d our sides, like age must run to rust,</li>
  <li class="number">And deck the temples of those gods that hate us;</li>
  <li class="number">These hands shall never draw ’em out like lightning</li>
  <li class="number">To blast whole armies more.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ARC.">
  <li class="number">No, Palamon,</li>
  <li class="number">Those hopes are prisoners with us. Here we are,</li>
  <li class="number">And here the graces of our youths must wither</li>
  <li class="number">Like a too-timely spring. Here age must find us,</li>
  <li class="number">And which is heaviest, Palamon, unmarried.</li>
  <li class="number">The sweet embraces of a loving wife,</li>
  <li class="number">Loaden with kisses, arm’d with thousand Cupids,</li>
  <li class="number">Shall never clasp our necks; no issue know us;</li>
  <li class="number">No figures of ourselves shall we ev’r see</li>
  <li class="number">To glad our age, and like young eagles teach ’em</li>
  <li class="number">Boldly to gaze against bright arms, and say,</li>
  <li class="number">“Remember what your fathers were, and conquer!”</li>
  <li class="number">The fair-ey’d maids shall weep our banishments,</li>
  <li class="number">And in their songs curse ever-blinded Fortune</li>
  <li class="number">Till she for shame see what a wrong she has done</li>
  <li class="number">To youth and nature. This is all our world:</li>
  <li class="number">We shall know nothing here but one another,</li>
  <li class="number">Hear nothing but the clock that tells our woes;</li>
  <li class="number">The vine shall grow, but we shall never see it;</li>
  <li class="number">Summer shall come, and with her all delights,</li>
  <li class="number">But dead-cold winter must inhabit here still.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAL.">
  <li class="number">’Tis too true, Arcite. To our Theban hounds,</li>
  <li class="number">That shook the aged forest with their echoes,</li>
  <li class="number">No more now must we hallow; no more shake</li>
  <li class="number">Our pointed javelins, whilst the angry swine</li>
  <li class="number">Flies like a Parthian quiver from our rages,</li>
  <li class="number">Struck with our well-steel’d darts. All valiant uses</li>
  <li class="number">(The food and nourishment of noble minds)</li>
  <li class="number">In us two here shall perish; we shall die</li>
  <li class="number">(Which is the curse of honor) lastly</li>
  <li class="number">Children of grief and ignorance.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ARC.">
  <li class="number">Yet, cousin,</li>
  <li class="number">Even from the bottom of these miseries,</li>
  <li class="number">From all that fortune can inflict upon us,</li>
  <li class="number">I see two comforts rising, two mere blessings,</li>
  <li class="number">If the gods please—to hold here a brave patience,</li>
  <li class="number">And the enjoying of our griefs together.</li>
  <li class="number">Whilst Palamon is with me, let me perish</li>
  <li class="number">If I think this our prison.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAL.">
  <li class="number">Certainly</li>
  <li class="number">’Tis a main goodness, cousin, that our fortunes</li>
  <li class="number">Were twin’d together. ’Tis most true, two souls</li>
  <li class="number">Put in two noble bodies, let ’em suffer</li>
  <li class="number">The gall of hazard, so they grow together,</li>
  <li class="number">Will never sink; they must not, say they could;</li>
  <li class="number">A willing man dies sleeping, and all’s done.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ARC.">
  <li class="number">Shall we make worthy uses of this place</li>
  <li class="number">That all men hate so much?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAL.">
  <li class="number">How, gentle cousin?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ARC.">
  <li class="number">Let’s think this prison holy sanctuary</li>
  <li class="number">To keep us from corruption of worse men.</li>
  <li class="number">We are young and yet desire the ways of honor,</li>
  <li class="number">That liberty and common conversation,</li>
  <li class="number">The poison of pure spirits, might, like women,</li>
  <li class="number">Woo us to wander from. What worthy blessing</li>
  <li class="number">Can be, but our imaginations</li>
  <li class="number">May make it ours? And here being thus together,</li>
  <li class="number">We are an endless mine to one another;</li>
  <li class="number">We are one another’s wife, ever begetting</li>
  <li class="number">New births of love; we are father, friends, acquaintance;</li>
  <li class="number">We are, in one another, families:</li>
  <li class="number">I am your heir, and you are mine; this place</li>
  <li class="number">Is our inheritance. No hard oppressor</li>
  <li class="number">Dare take this from us; here with a little patience</li>
  <li class="number">We shall live long, and loving. No surfeits seek us;</li>
  <li class="number">The hand of war hurts none here, nor the seas</li>
  <li class="number">Swallow their youth. Were we at liberty,</li>
  <li class="number">A wife might part us lawfully, or business,</li>
  <li class="number">Quarrels consume us, envy of ill men</li>
  <li class="number">Crave our acquaintance; I might sicken, cousin,</li>
  <li class="number">Where you should never know it, and so perish</li>
  <li class="number">Without your noble hand to close mine eyes,</li>
  <li class="number">Or prayers to the gods. A thousand chances,</li>
  <li class="number">Were we from hence, would sever us.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAL.">
  <li class="number">You have made me</li>
  <li class="number">(I thank you, cousin Arcite) almost wanton</li>
  <li class="number">With my captivity. What a misery</li>
  <li class="number">It is to live abroad, and every where!</li>
  <li class="number">’Tis like a beast, methinks. I find the court here,</li>
  <li class="number">I am sure, a more content, and all those pleasures</li>
  <li class="number">That woo the wills of men to vanity</li>
  <li class="number">I see through now, and am sufficient</li>
  <li class="number">To tell the world ’tis but a gaudy shadow</li>
  <li class="number">That old Time, as he passes by, takes with him.</li>
  <li class="number">What had we been, old in the court of Creon,</li>
  <li class="number">Where sin is justice, lust and ignorance</li>
  <li class="number">The virtues of the great ones? Cousin Arcite,</li>
  <li class="number">Had not the loving gods found this place for us,</li>
  <li class="number">We had died as they do, ill old men, unwept,</li>
  <li class="number">And had their epitaphs, the people’s curses.</li>
  <li class="number">Shall I say more?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ARC.">
  <li class="number">I would hear you still.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAL.">

  <li class="number">Sure there cannot.</li>

<ol data-speaker="EMIL.">
  <li class="number">It is the very emblem of a maid;</li>

  <li class="number">With her chaste blushes! When the north comes near her,</li>
  <li class="number">Rude and impatient, then, like chastity,</li>
  <li class="number">She locks her beauties in her bud again,</li>

  <li class="number">Yet, good madam,</li>

  <li class="number">His iron bracelets are not off. O Love,</li>
  <li class="number">What a stout-hearted child thou art! My father</li>
  <li class="number">Durst better have endur’d cold iron than done it.</li>
  <li class="number">I love him beyond love and beyond reason,</li>
  <li class="number">Or wit, or safety. I have made him know it.</li>
  <li class="number">I care not, I am desperate. If the law</li>
  <li class="number">Find me, and then condemn me for’t, some wenches,</li>
  <li class="number">Some honest-hearted maids, will sing my dirge,</li>
  <li class="number">And tell to memory my death was noble,</li>
  <li class="number">Dying almost a martyr. That way he takes</li>
  <li class="number">I purpose is my way too. Sure he cannot</li>
  <li class="number">Be so unmanly as to leave me here.</li>
  <li class="number">If he do, maids will not so easily</li>
  <li class="number">Trust men again. And yet he has not thank’d me</li>
  <li class="number">For what I have done; no, not so much as kiss’d me;</li>
  <li class="number">And that, methinks, is not so well; nor scarcely</li>
  <li class="number">Could I persuade him to become a freeman,</li>
  <li class="number">He made such scruples of the wrong he did</li>
  <li class="number">To me and to my father. Yet I hope,</li>
  <li class="number">When he considers more, this love of mine</li>
  <li class="number">Will take more root within him. Let him do</li>
  <li class="number">What he will with me, so he use me kindly,</li>
  <li class="number">For use me so he shall, or I’ll proclaim him,</li>
  <li class="number">And to his face, no man. I’ll presently</li>
  <li class="number">Provide him necessaries, and pack my clothes up,</li>
  <li class="number">And where there is a path of ground I’ll venture,</li>
  <li class="number">So he be with me. By him, like a shadow,</li>
  <li class="number">I’ll ever dwell. Within this hour the whoobub</li>
  <li class="number">Will be all o’er the prison. I am then</li>
  <li class="number">Kissing the man they look for. Farewell, father;</li>
  <li class="number">Get many more such prisoners and such daughters,</li>
  <li class="number">And shortly you may keep yourself. Now to him!</li>

  <li class="number">In the great lake that lies behind the palace,</li>
  <li class="number">From the far shore, thick set with reeds and sedges,</li>
  <li class="number">As patiently I was attending sport,</li>
  <li class="number">I heard a voice, a shrill one; and attentive</li>
  <li class="number">I gave my ear, when I might well perceive</li>
  <li class="number">’Twas one that sung, and by the smallness of it,</li>
  <li class="number">A boy or woman. I then left my angle</li>
  <li class="number">To his own skill, came near, but yet perceiv’d not</li>
  <li class="number">Who made the sound, the rushes and the reeds</li>
  <li class="number">Had so encompass’d it. I laid me down</li>
  <li class="number">And list’ned to the words she sung, for then</li>
  <li class="number">Through a small glade cut by the fishermen,</li>
  <li class="number">I saw it was your daughter.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JAIL.">
  <li class="number">Pray go on, sir.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WOOER.">
  <li class="number">She sung much, but no sense; only I heard her</li>
  <li class="number">Repeat this often, “Palamon is gone,</li>
  <li class="number">Is gone to th’ wood to gather mulberries.</li>
  <li class="number">I’ll find him out tomorrow.”</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. FRIEND.">

  <li class="number">“His shackles will betray him, he’ll be taken,</li>
  <li class="number">And what shall I do then? I’ll bring a bevy,</li>
  <li class="number">A hundred black-ey’d maids that love as I do,</li>
  <li class="number">With chaplets on their heads of daffadillies,</li>
  <li class="number">With cherry lips and cheeks of damask roses,</li>
  <li class="number">And all we’ll dance an antic ’fore the Duke,</li>
  <li class="number">And beg his pardon.” Then she talk’d of you, sir:</li>
  <li class="number">That you must lose your head tomorrow morning,</li>
  <li class="number">And she must gather flowers to bury you,</li>
  <li class="number">And see the house made handsome. Then she sung</li>
  <li class="number">Nothing but “Willow, willow, willow,” and between</li>
  <li class="number">Ever was “Palamon, fair Palamon,”</li>
  <li class="number">And “Palamon was a tall young man.” The place</li>
  <li class="number">Was knee-deep where she sat; her careless tresses</li>
  <li class="number">A wreath of bulrush rounded; about her stuck</li>
  <li class="number">Thousand fresh water-flowers of several colors,</li>
  <li class="number">That methought she appear’d like the fair nymph</li>
  <li class="number">That feeds the lake with waters, or as Iris</li>
  <li class="number">Newly dropp’d down from heaven. Rings she made</li>
  <li class="number">Of rushes that grew by, and to ’em spoke</li>
  <li class="number">The prettiest posies—“Thus our true love’s tied,”</li>
  <li class="number">“This you may loose, not me,” and many a one;</li>
  <li class="number">And then she wept, and sung again, and sigh’d,</li>
  <li class="number">And with the same breath smil’d, and kiss’d her hand.</li>

  <li class="number">I made in to her.</li>

  <li class="number">She slipp’d away, and to the city made</li>
  <li class="number">With such a cry and swiftness that, believe me,</li>
  <li class="number">She left me far behind her. Three or four</li>
  <li class="number">I saw from far off cross her—one of ’em</li>
  <li class="number">I knew to be your brother; where she stay’d,</li>

<ol data-speaker="EMIL.">
  <li class="number">Yet I may bind those wounds up, that must open</li>
  <li class="number">And bleed to death for my sake else. I’ll choose,</li>
  <li class="number">And end their strife. Two such young handsome men</li>
  <li class="number">Shall never fall for me; their weeping mothers,</li>
  <li class="number">Following the dead-cold ashes of their sons,</li>
  <li class="number">Shall never curse my cruelty. Good heaven,</li>
  <li class="number">What a sweet face has Arcite! If wise Nature,</li>
  <li class="number">With all her best endowments, all those beauties</li>
  <li class="number">She sows into the births of noble bodies,</li>
  <li class="number">Were here a mortal woman, and had in her</li>
  <li class="number">The coy denials of young maids, yet doubtless</li>
  <li class="number">She would run mad for this man. What an eye,</li>
  <li class="number">Of what a fiery sparkle and quick sweetness,</li>
  <li class="number">Has this young prince! Here Love himself sits smiling.</li>
  <li class="number">Just such another wanton Ganymede</li>
  <li class="number">Set Jove afire with, and enforc’d the god</li>
  <li class="number">Snatch up the goodly boy and set him by him,</li>
  <li class="number">A shining constellation. What a brow,</li>
  <li class="number">Of what a spacious majesty, he carries,</li>
  <li class="number">Arch’d like the great-ey’d Juno’s, but far sweeter,</li>
  <li class="number">Smoother than Pelops’ shoulder! Fame and Honor</li>
  <li class="number">Methinks from hence, as from a promontory</li>
  <li class="number">Pointed in heaven, should clap their wings and sing</li>
  <li class="number">To all the under world the loves and fights</li>
  <li class="number">Of gods and such men near ’em. Palamon</li>
  <li class="number">Is but his foil, to him, a mere dull shadow;</li>
  <li class="number">He’s swarth and meagre, of an eye as heavy</li>
  <li class="number">As if he had lost his mother; a still temper,</li>
  <li class="number">No stirring in him, no alacrity,</li>
  <li class="number">Of all this sprightly sharpness, not a smile.</li>
  <li class="number">Yet these that we count errors may become him:</li>
  <li class="number">Narcissus was a sad boy, but a heavenly.</li>
  <li class="number">O, who can find the bent of woman’s fancy?</li>
  <li class="number">I am a fool, my reason is lost in me;</li>
  <li class="number">I have no choice, and I have lied so lewdly</li>
  <li class="number">That women ought to beat me. On my knees</li>
  <li class="number">I ask thy pardon: Palamon, thou art alone</li>
  <li class="number">And only beautiful, and these the eyes,</li>
  <li class="number">These the bright lamps of beauty, that command</li>
  <li class="number">And threaten Love, and what young maid dare cross ’em?</li>
  <li class="number">What a bold gravity, and yet inviting,</li>
  <li class="number">Has this brown manly face! O Love, this only</li>
  <li class="number">From this hour is complexion. Lie there, Arcite,</li>
  <li class="number">Thou art a changeling to him, a mere gypsy,</li>
  <li class="number">And this the noble body. I am sotted,</li>
  <li class="number">Utterly lost. My virgin’s faith has fled me;</li>
  <li class="number">For if my brother but even now had ask’d me</li>
  <li class="number">Whether I lov’d, I had run mad for Arcite;</li>
  <li class="number">Now if my sister—more for Palamon.</li>
  <li class="number">Stand both together: now, come ask me, brother—</li>
  <li class="number">Alas, I know not! Ask me now, sweet sister—</li>
  <li class="number">I may go look! What a mere child is fancy,</li>
  <li class="number">That having two fair gauds of equal sweetness,</li>
  <li class="number">Cannot distinguish, but must cry for both!</li>

  <li class="number">I will, sir,</li>
  <li class="number">And truly what I think. Six braver spirits</li>
  <li class="number">Than these they have brought (if we judge by the outside)</li>
  <li class="number">I never saw nor read of. He that stands</li>
  <li class="number">In the first place with Arcite, by his seeming</li>
  <li class="number">Should be a stout man, by his face a prince</li>
  <li class="number">(His very looks so say him), his complexion</li>
  <li class="number">Nearer a brown than black; stern, and yet noble,</li>
  <li class="number">Which shows him hardy, fearless, proud of dangers.</li>
  <li class="number">The circles of his eyes show fire within him,</li>
  <li class="number">And as a heated lion, so he looks;</li>
  <li class="number">His hair hangs long behind him, black and shining</li>
  <li class="number">Like ravens’ wings; his shoulders broad and strong,</li>
  <li class="number">Arm’d long and round, and on his thigh a sword</li>
  <li class="number">Hung by a curious baldrick, when he frowns</li>
  <li class="number">To seal his will with. Better, o’ my conscience,</li>
  <li class="number">Was never soldier’s friend.</li>

  <li class="number">Pray speak him, friend.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PIR.">
  <li class="number">I guess he is a prince too,</li>
  <li class="number">And if it may be, greater; for his show</li>
  <li class="number">Has all the ornament of honor in’t.</li>
  <li class="number">He’s somewhat bigger than the knight he spoke of,</li>
  <li class="number">But of a face far sweeter; his complexion</li>
  <li class="number">Is, as a ripe grape, ruddy. He has felt</li>
  <li class="number">Without doubt what he fights for, and so apter</li>
  <li class="number">To make this cause his own. In ’s face appears</li>
  <li class="number">All the fair hopes of what he undertakes,</li>
  <li class="number">And when he’s angry, then a settled valor</li>
  <li class="number">(Not tainted with extremes) runs through his body,</li>
  <li class="number">And guides his arm to brave things. Fear he cannot,</li>
  <li class="number">He shows no such soft temper. His head’s yellow,</li>
  <li class="number">Hard-hair’d, and curl’d, thick twin’d like ivy-tods,</li>
  <li class="number">Not to undo with thunder. In his face</li>
  <li class="number">The livery of the warlike maid appears,</li>
  <li class="number">Pure red and white, for yet no beard has blest him;</li>
  <li class="number">And in his rolling eyes sits victory,</li>
  <li class="number">As if she ever meant to crown his valor.</li>
  <li class="number">His nose stands high, a character of honor;</li>

  <li class="number">His age some five and twenty.</li>

<ol data-speaker="1. MESS.">

  <li class="number">Great and fine art in nature. He’s white-hair’d,</li>
  <li class="number">Not wanton white, but such a manly color</li>
  <li class="number">Next to an auburn; tough and nimble set,</li>
  <li class="number">Which shows an active soul; his arms are brawny,</li>
  <li class="number">Lin’d with strong sinews; to the shoulder-piece</li>
  <li class="number">Gently they swell, like women new conceiv’d,</li>
  <li class="number">Which speaks him prone to labor, never fainting</li>
  <li class="number">Under the weight of arms; stout-hearted, still,</li>
  <li class="number">But when he stirs, a tiger. He’s grey-ey’d,</li>
  <li class="number">Which yields compassion where he conquers; sharp</li>
  <li class="number">To spy advantages, and where he finds ’em,</li>
  <li class="number">He’s swift to make ’em his. He does no wrongs,</li>
  <li class="number">Nor takes none. He’s round-fac’d, and when he smiles</li>
  <li class="number">He shows a lover, when he frowns, a soldier.</li>
  <li class="number">About his head he wears the winner’s oak,</li>
  <li class="number">And in it stuck the favor of his lady.</li>
  <li class="number">His age some six and thirty. In his hand</li>
  <li class="number">He bears a charging-staff emboss’d with silver.</li>

  <li class="number">She is continually in a harmless distemper, sleeps little, altogether without appetite, save often drinking, dreaming of another world and a better; and what broken piece of matter soe’er she’s about, the name Palamon lards it, that she farces ev’ry business withal, fits it to every question.</li>

  <li class="number">Now for this charm that I told you of, you must bring a piece of silver on the tip of your tongue, or no ferry. Then, if it be your chance to come where the blessed spirits—as there’s a sight now! We maids that have our livers perish’d, crack’d to pieces with love, we shall come there, and do nothing all day long but pick flowers with Proserpine. Then will I make Palamon a nosegay, then let him mark me—then—</li>

Alas, ’tis a sore life they have i’ th’ tother place, such burning, frying, boiling, hissing, howling, chatt’ring, cursing! O, they have shrewd measure! Take heed: if one be mad, or hang or drown themselves, thither they go—Jupiter bless us!—and there shall we be put in a cauldron of lead and usurers’ grease, amongst a whole million of cutpurses, and there boil like a gammon of bacon that will never be enough.</li>

<ol data-speaker="WOOER.">
  <li class="number">I did think so too, and would account I had a great penn’worth on’t to give half my state that both she and I at this present stood unfeignedly on the same terms.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DOCT.">
  <li class="number">That intemp’rate surfeit of her eye hath distemper’d the other senses. They may return and settle again to execute their preordain’d faculties, but they are now in a most extravagant vagary. This you must do: confine her to a place where the light may rather seem to steal in than be permitted. Take upon you, young sir her friend, the name of Palamon, say you come to eat with her, and to commune of love. This will catch her attention, for this her mind beats upon; other objects that are inserted ’tween her mind and eye become the pranks and friskins of her madness. Sing to her such green songs of love as she says Palamon hath sung in prison. Come to her, stuck in as sweet flowers as the season is mistress of, and thereto make an addition of some other compounded odors which are grateful to the sense. All this shall become Palamon, for Palamon can sing, and Palamon is sweet, and ev’ry good thing. Desire to eat with her, carve her, drink to her, and still among intermingle your petition of grace and acceptance into her favor. Learn what maids have been her companions and play-feres, and let them repair to her with Palamon in their mouths, and appear with tokens, as if they suggested for him. It is a falsehood she is in, which is with falsehoods to be combated. This may bring her to eat, to sleep, and reduce what’s now out of square in her into their former law and regiment. I have seen it approv’d, how many times I know not, but to make the number more I have great hope in this. I will, between the passages of this project, come in with my appliance. Let us put it in execution; and hasten the success, which doubt not will bring forth comfort.</li>

  <li class="number">Becomes the rider’s load. Yet is he living,</li>
