<ol data-speaker="PAIN.">
  <li class="number">It wears, sir, as it grows.</li>

<ol data-speaker="POET.">
  <li class="number">Ay, that’s well known;</li>
  <li class="number">But what particular rarity? What strange,</li>
  <li class="number">Which manifold record not matches? See,</li>
  <li class="number">Magic of bounty! All these spirits thy power</li>
  <li class="number">Hath conjur’d to attend. I know the merchant.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAIN.">
  <li class="number">I know them both; th’ other’s a jeweler.</li>

  <li class="number">O, ’tis a worthy lord.</li>

<ol data-speaker="JEW.">
  <li class="number">Nay, that’s most fix’d.</li>

<ol data-speaker="MER.">
  <li class="number">A most incomparable man, breath’d, as it were,</li>
  <li class="number">To an untirable and continuate goodness;</li>

<ol data-speaker="JEW.">
  <li class="number">I have a jewel here—</li>

  <li class="number">O, pray let’s see’t. For the Lord Timon, sir?</li>

</li>
  <li class="number">’Tis a good form.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="JEW.">
  <li class="number">And rich. Here is a water, look ye.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAIN.">
  <li class="number">You are rapt, sir, in some work, some dedication</li>
  <li class="number">To the great lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POET.">
  <li class="number">A thing slipp’d idlely from me.</li>
  <li class="number">Our poesy is as a gum, which oozes</li>
  <li class="number">From whence ’tis nourish’d. The fire i’ th’ flint</li>
  <li class="number">Shows not till it be struck; our gentle flame</li>
  <li class="number">Provokes itself and like the current flies</li>
  <li class="number">Each bound it chases. What have you there?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAIN.">
  <li class="number">A picture, sir. When comes your book forth?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POET.">
  <li class="number">Upon the heels of my presentment, sir.</li>
  <li class="number">Let’s see your piece.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAIN.">
  <li class="number">’Tis a good piece.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POET.">
  <li class="number">So ’tis. This comes off well and excellent.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAIN.">
  <li class="number">Indifferent.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POET.">
  <li class="number">Admirable! How this grace</li>
  <li class="number">Speaks his own standing! What a mental power</li>
  <li class="number">This eye shoots forth! How big imagination</li>
  <li class="number">Moves in this lip! To th’ dumbness of the gesture</li>
  <li class="number">One might interpret.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAIN.">
  <li class="number">It is a pretty mocking of the life.</li>
  <li class="number">Here is a touch; is’t good?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POET.">
  <li class="number">I will say of it,</li>
  <li class="number">It tutors nature. Artificial strife</li>

  <li class="number">The senators of Athens, happy men!</li>

  <li class="number">Look, more!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POET.">
  <li class="number">You see this confluence, this great flood of visitors.</li>
  <li class="number">I have, in this rough work, shap’d out a man</li>
  <li class="number">Whom this beneath world doth embrace and hug</li>
  <li class="number">With amplest entertainment. My free drift</li>
  <li class="number">Halts not particularly, but moves itself</li>
  <li class="number">In a wide sea of wax; no levell’d malice</li>
  <li class="number">Infects one comma in the course I hold,</li>
  <li class="number">But flies an eagle flight, bold, and forth on,</li>
  <li class="number">Leaving no tract behind.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAIN.">
  <li class="number">How shall I understand you?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POET.">
  <li class="number">I will unbolt to you.</li>
  <li class="number">You see how all conditions, how all minds,</li>
  <li class="number">As well of glib and slipp’ry creatures as</li>
  <li class="number">Of grave and austere quality, tender down</li>
  <li class="number">Their services to Lord Timon. His large fortune,</li>
  <li class="number">Upon his good and gracious nature hanging,</li>
  <li class="number">Subdues and properties to his love and tendance</li>
  <li class="number">All sorts of hearts; yea, from the glass-fac’d flatterer</li>
  <li class="number">To Apemantus, that few things loves better</li>
  <li class="number">Than to abhor himself; even he drops down</li>
  <li class="number">The knee before him, and returns in peace</li>
  <li class="number">Most rich in Timon’s nod.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAIN.">
  <li class="number">I saw them speak together.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POET.">
  <li class="number">Sir, I have upon a high and pleasant hill</li>
  <li class="number">Feign’d Fortune to be thron’d. The base o’ th’ mount</li>
  <li class="number">Is rank’d with all deserts, all kind of natures,</li>
  <li class="number">That labor on the bosom of this sphere</li>
  <li class="number">To propagate their states. Amongst them all,</li>
  <li class="number">Whose eyes are on this sovereign lady fix’d,</li>
  <li class="number">One do I personate of Lord Timon’s frame,</li>
  <li class="number">Whom Fortune with her ivory hand wafts to her,</li>
  <li class="number">Whose present grace to present slaves and servants</li>
  <li class="number">Translates his rivals.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAIN.">
  <li class="number">’Tis conceiv’d to scope.</li>
  <li class="number">This throne, this Fortune, and this hill, methinks,</li>
  <li class="number">With one man beckon’d from the rest below,</li>
  <li class="number">Bowing his head against the steepy mount</li>
  <li class="number">To climb his happiness, would be well express’d</li>
  <li class="number">In our condition.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POET.">
  <li class="number">Nay, sir, but hear me on:</li>
  <li class="number">All those which were his fellows but of late—</li>
  <li class="number">Some better than his value—on the moment</li>
  <li class="number">Follow his strides, his lobbies fill with tendance,</li>
  <li class="number">Rain sacrificial whisperings in his ear,</li>
  <li class="number">Make sacred even his stirrup, and through him</li>
  <li class="number">Drink the free air.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAIN.">
  <li class="number">Ay, marry, what of these?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POET.">
  <li class="number">When Fortune in her shift and change of mood</li>
  <li class="number">Spurns down her late beloved, all his dependents</li>
  <li class="number">Which labor’d after him to the mountain’s top</li>
  <li class="number">Even on their knees and hands, let him slip down,</li>
  <li class="number">Not one accompanying his declining foot.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAIN.">
  <li class="number">’Tis common:</li>
  <li class="number">A thousand moral paintings I can show</li>
  <li class="number">That shall demonstrate these quick blows of Fortune’s</li>
  <li class="number">More pregnantly than words. Yet you do well</li>
  <li class="number">To show Lord Timon that mean eyes have seen</li>
  <li class="number">The foot above the head.</li>

<ol data-speaker="OLD ATH.">
  <li class="number">This fellow here, Lord Timon, this thy creature,</li>

  <li class="number">Well; what further?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OLD ATH.">
  <li class="number">One only daughter have I, no kin else,</li>

  <li class="number">The maid is fair, a’ th’ youngest for a bride,</li>
  <li class="number">And I have bred her at my dearest cost</li>

<ol data-speaker="TIM.">
  <li class="number">The man is honest.</li>

<ol data-speaker="OLD ATH.">
  <li class="number">Therefore he will be, Timon.</li>

I have told more of you to myself than you can with modesty speak in your own behalf; and thus far I confirm you. O you gods, think I, what need we have any friends, if we should ne’er have need of ’em? They were the most needless creatures living, should we ne’er have use for ’em; and would most resemble sweet instruments hung up in cases, that keeps their sounds to themselves. Why, I have often wish’d myself poorer, that I might come nearer to you. We are born to do benefits; and what better or properer can we call our own than the riches of our friends? O, what a precious comfort ’tis to have so many like brothers commanding one another’s fortunes! O, joy’s e’en made away ere’t can be born! Mine eyes cannot hold out water, methinks.

<ol data-speaker="LUCUL.">
  <li class="number">La, la, la, la! “nothing doubting,” says he? Alas, good lord! A noble gentleman ’tis, if he would not keep so good a house. Many a time and often I ha’ din’d with him, and told him on’t, and come again to supper to him of purpose to have him spend less, and yet he would embrace no counsel, take no warning by my coming.

</div>

<ol data-speaker="LUC.">
  <li class="number">Who, the Lord Timon? He is my very good friend, and an honorable gentleman.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. STRAN.">
  <li class="number">We know him for no less, though we are but strangers to him. But I can tell you one thing, my lord, and which I hear from common rumors, now Lord Timon’s happy hours are done and past, and his estate shrinks from him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUC.">
  <li class="number">Fie, no, do not believe it; he cannot want for money.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="2. STRAN.">
  <li class="number">But believe you this, my lord, that not long ago one of his men was with the Lord Lucullus to borrow so many talents, nay, urg’d extremely for’t, and show’d what necessity belong’d to’t, and yet was denied.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUC.">
  <li class="number">How?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="2. STRAN.">
  <li class="number">I tell you, denied, my lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUC.">
  <li class="number">What a strange case was that! Now before the gods, I am asham’d on’t. Denied that honorable man? There was very little honor show’d in’t. For my own part, I must needs confess, I have receiv’d some small kindnesses from him, as money, plate, jewels, and such like trifles—nothing comparing to his—yet had he mistook him and sent to me, I should ne’er have denied his occasion so many talents.</li>
</ol>

  <li class="number">See, by good hap, yonder’s my lord; I have sweat to see his honor. My honor’d lord—</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUC.">
  <li class="number">Servilius? You are kindly met, sir. Fare thee well, commend me to thy honorable virtuous lord, my very exquisite friend.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SER.">
  <li class="number">May it please your honor, my lord hath sent—</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUC.">
  <li class="number">Ha? What has he sent? I am so much endear’d to that lord: he’s ever sending. How shall I thank him, think’st thou? And what has he sent now?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SER.">
  <li class="number">H’as only sent his present occasion now, my lord; requesting your lordship to supply his instant use with so many talents.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUC.">
  <li class="number">I know his lordship is but merry with me;</li>
  <li class="number">He cannot want fifty—five hundred talents.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SER.">
  <li class="number">But in the mean time he wants less, my lord.</li>
  <li class="number">If his occasion were not virtuous,</li>
  <li class="number">I should not urge it half so faithfully.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUC.">
  <li class="number">Dost thou speak seriously, Servilius?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SER.">
  <li class="number">Upon my soul, ’tis true, sir.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUC.">
  <li class="number">What a wicked beast was I to disfurnish myself against such a good time, when I might ha’ shown myself honorable! How unluckily it happ’ned that I should purchase the day before for a little part, and undo a great deal of honor! Servilius, now before the gods, I am not able to do (the more beast, I say!)—I was sending to use Lord Timon myself, these gentlemen can witness; but I would not, for the wealth of Athens, I had done’t now. Commend me bountifully to his good lordship, and I hope his honor will conceive the fairest of me, because I have no power to be kind. And tell him this from me, I count it one of my greatest afflictions, say, that I cannot pleasure such an honorable gentleman. Good Servilius, will you befriend me so far as to use mine own words to him?</li>

  <li class="number">Why, this is the world’s soul, and just of the same piece</li>
  <li class="number">Is every flatterer’s sport. Who can call him</li>
  <li class="number">His friend that dips in the same dish? For, in</li>
  <li class="number">My knowing, Timon has been this lord’s father,</li>
  <li class="number">And kept his credit with his purse;</li>
  <li class="number">Supported his estate, nay, Timon’s money</li>
  <li class="number">Has paid his men their wages. He ne’er drinks</li>
  <li class="number">But Timon’s silver treads upon his lip,</li>
  <li class="number">And yet—O, see the monstrousness of man</li>
  <li class="number">When he looks out in an ungrateful shape!—</li>
  <li class="number">He does deny him (in respect of his)</li>
  <li class="number">What charitable men afford to beggars.</li>

  <li class="number">And honorable carriage,</li>
  <li class="number">Had his necessity made use of me,</li>

<ol data-speaker="1. SEN.">
  <li class="number">My lord, you have my voice to’t; the fault’s</li>

  <li class="number">Nothing emboldens sin so much as mercy.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="2. SEN.">
  <li class="number">Most true; the law shall bruise ’em.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ALCIB.">
  <li class="number">Honor, health, and compassion to the Senate!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. SEN.">
  <li class="number">Now, captain?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ALCIB.">
  <li class="number">I am an humble suitor to your virtues;</li>
  <li class="number">For pity is the virtue of the law,</li>
  <li class="number">And none but tyrants use it cruelly.</li>
  <li class="number">It pleases time and fortune to lie heavy</li>
  <li class="number">Upon a friend of mine, who in hot blood</li>
  <li class="number">Hath stepp’d into the law, which is past depth</li>
  <li class="number">To those that (without heed) do plunge into’t.</li>
  <li class="number">He is a man (setting his fate aside)</li>
  <li class="number">Of comely virtues;</li>
  <li class="number">Nor did he soil the fact with cowardice</li>
  <li class="number">(An honor in him which buys out his fault),</li>
  <li class="number">But with a noble fury and fair spirit,</li>
  <li class="number">Seeing his reputation touch’d to death,</li>
  <li class="number">He did oppose his foe;</li>
  <li class="number">And with such sober and unnoted passion</li>
  <li class="number">He did behoove his anger, ere ’twas spent,</li>
  <li class="number">As if he had but prov’d an argument.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. SEN.">
  <li class="number">You undergo too strict a paradox,</li>
  <li class="number">Striving to make an ugly deed look fair.</li>
  <li class="number">Your words have took such pains as if they labor’d</li>
  <li class="number">To bring manslaughter into form, and set quarreling</li>
  <li class="number">Upon the head of valor; which indeed</li>
  <li class="number">Is valor misbegot, and came into the world</li>
  <li class="number">When sects and factions were newly born.</li>
  <li class="number">He’s truly valiant that can wisely suffer</li>
  <li class="number">The worst that man can breathe, and make his wrongs</li>
  <li class="number">His outsides, to wear them like his raiment, carelessly,</li>
  <li class="number">And ne’er prefer his injuries to his heart,</li>
  <li class="number">To bring it into danger.</li>
  <li class="number">If wrongs be evils and enforce us kill,</li>
  <li class="number">What folly ’tis to hazard life for ill!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ALCIB.">
  <li class="number">My lord—</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. SEN.">
  <li class="number">You cannot make gross sins look clear;</li>
  <li class="number">To revenge is no valor, but to bear.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ALCIB.">
  <li class="number">My lords, then, under favor, pardon me</li>
  <li class="number">If I speak like a captain.</li>
  <li class="number">Why do fond men expose themselves to battle,</li>
  <li class="number">And not endure all threats? Sleep upon’t,</li>
  <li class="number">And let the foes quietly cut their throats</li>
  <li class="number">Without repugnancy? If there be</li>
  <li class="number">Such valor in the bearing, what make we</li>
  <li class="number">Abroad? Why then, women are more valiant</li>
  <li class="number">That stay at home, if bearing carry it;</li>
  <li class="number">And the ass more captain than the lion, the fellow</li>
  <li class="number">Loaden with irons wiser than the judge,</li>
  <li class="number">If wisdom be in suffering. O my lords,</li>
  <li class="number">As you are great, be pitifully good.</li>
  <li class="number">Who cannot condemn rashness in cold blood?</li>
  <li class="number">To kill, I grant, is sin’s extremest gust,</li>
  <li class="number">But in defense, by mercy, ’tis most just.</li>
  <li class="number">To be in anger is impiety;</li>
  <li class="number">But who is man that is not angry?</li>
  <li class="number">Weigh but the crime with this.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="2. SEN.">
  <li class="number">You breathe in vain.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ALCIB.">
  <li class="number">In vain? His service done</li>
  <li class="number">At Lacedaemon and Byzantium</li>
  <li class="number">Were a sufficient briber for his life.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. SEN.">
  <li class="number">What’s that?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ALCIB.">
  <li class="number">Why, I say, my lords, h’as done fair service,</li>
  <li class="number">And slain in fight many of your enemies.</li>
  <li class="number">How full of valor did he bear himself</li>
  <li class="number">In the last conflict, and made plenteous wounds!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="2. SEN.">
  <li class="number">He has made too much plenty with ’em.</li>
  <li class="number">He’s a sworn rioter; he has a sin that often</li>
  <li class="number">Drowns him and takes his valor prisoner.</li>
  <li class="number">If there were no foes, that were enough</li>
  <li class="number">To overcome him. In that beastly fury</li>
  <li class="number">He has been known to commit outrages</li>
  <li class="number">And cherish factions. ’Tis inferr’d to us,</li>
  <li class="number">His days are foul and his drink dangerous.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. SEN.">
  <li class="number">He dies.</li>

  <li class="number">Hard fate! He might have died in war.</li>
  <li class="number">My lords, if not for any parts in him—</li>
  <li class="number">Though his right arm might purchase his own time</li>
  <li class="number">And be in debt to none—yet more to move you,</li>
  <li class="number">Take my deserts to his, and join ’em both;</li>
  <li class="number">And for I know your reverend ages love</li>
  <li class="number">Security, I’ll pawn my victories, all</li>
  <li class="number">My honor to you, upon his good returns.</li>
  <li class="number">If by this crime he owes the law his life,</li>
  <li class="number">Why, let the war receive’t in valiant gore,</li>
  <li class="number">For law is strict, and war is nothing more.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. SEN.">
  <li class="number">We are for law, he dies, urge it no more</li>

Let no assembly of twenty be without a score of villains. If there sit twelve women at the table, let a dozen of them be—as they are. The rest of your fees, O gods—the senators of Athens, together with the common lag of people—what is amiss in them, you gods, make suitable for destruction.

  <li class="number">In limited professions. Rascal thieves,</li>
  <li class="number">Here’s gold. Go, suck the subtle blood o’ th’ grape,</li>
  <li class="number">Till the high fever seethe your blood to froth,</li>
  <li class="number">And so scape hanging. Trust not the physician,</li>
  <li class="number">His antidotes are poison, and he slays</li>
  <li class="number">More than you rob. Take wealth and lives together,</li>
  <li class="number">Do, villains, do, since you protest to do’t.</li>
  <li class="number">Like workmen, I’ll example you with thievery:</li>
  <li class="number">The sun’s a thief, and with his great attraction</li>
  <li class="number">Robs the vast sea; the moon’s an arrant thief,</li>
  <li class="number">And her pale fire she snatches from the sun;</li>
  <li class="number">The sea’s a thief, whose liquid surge resolves</li>
  <li class="number">The moon into salt tears; the earth’s a thief,</li>
  <li class="number">That feeds and breeds by a composture stol’n</li>
  <li class="number">From gen’ral excrement; each thing’s a thief.</li>
  <li class="number">The laws, your curb and whip, in their rough power</li>
  <li class="number">Has uncheck’d theft. Love not yourselves, away,</li>
  <li class="number">Rob one another. There’s more gold. Cut throats,</li>
  <li class="number">All that you meet are thieves. To Athens go,</li>
  <li class="number">Break open shops; nothing can you steal</li>
  <li class="number">But thieves do lose it. Steal less for this I give you,</li>
  <li class="number">And gold confound you howsoe’er! Amen.</li>

  <li class="number">(For I must ever doubt, though ne’er so sure),</li>
  <li class="number">Is not thy kindness subtle, covetous,</li>

  <li class="number">Expecting in return twenty for one?</li>

  <li class="number">Suspect still comes where an estate is least.</li>

  <li class="number">Duty, and zeal to your unmatched mind,</li>
  <li class="number">Care of your food and living; and believe it,</li>
  <li class="number">My most honor’d lord,</li>

  <li class="number">Hate all, curse all, show charity to none,</li>
  <li class="number">But let the famish’d flesh slide from the bone</li>

  <li class="number">As I took note of the place, it cannot be far</li>
  <li class="number">Where he abides.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POET.">
  <li class="number">What’s to be thought of him?</li>
  <li class="number">Does the rumor hold for true that he’s</li>
  <li class="number">So full of gold?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAIN.">
  <li class="number">Certain. Alcibiades reports it;</li>
  <li class="number">Phrynia and Timandra had gold of him.</li>
  <li class="number">He likewise enrich’d poor straggling soldiers with</li>
  <li class="number">Great quantity. ’Tis said he gave unto</li>
  <li class="number">His steward a mighty sum.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POET.">
  <li class="number">Then this breaking of his</li>

  <li class="number">Nothing else.</li>
  <li class="number">You shall see him a palm in Athens again, and flourish</li>
  <li class="number">With the highest. Therefore, ’tis not amiss</li>
  <li class="number">We tender our loves to him in this suppos’d</li>
  <li class="number">Distress of his; it will show honestly in us,</li>
  <li class="number">And is very likely to load our purposes</li>

  <li class="number">And but in the plainer and simpler kind of people</li>
  <li class="number">The deed of saying is quite out of use.</li>
  <li class="number">To promise is most courtly and fashionable;</li>

  <li class="number">Of Alcibiades th’ approaches wild,</li>

<ol data-speaker="TIM.">
  <li class="number">Well, sir, I will; therefore I will, sir, thus:</li>
  <li class="number">If Alcibiades kill my countrymen,</li>
  <li class="number">Let Alcibiades know this of Timon,</li>
  <li class="number">That Timon cares not. But if he sack fair Athens,</li>
  <li class="number">And take our goodly aged men by th’ beards,</li>
  <li class="number">Giving our holy virgins to the stain</li>
  <li class="number">Of contumelious, beastly, mad-brain’d war,</li>
  <li class="number">Then let him know, and tell him Timon speaks it,</li>
  <li class="number">In pity of our aged and our youth,</li>
  <li class="number">I cannot choose but tell him that I care not,</li>
  <li class="number">And let him take’t at worst—for their knives care not,</li>
  <li class="number">While you have throats to answer. For myself,</li>
  <li class="number">There’s not a whittle in th’ unruly camp</li>
  <li class="number">But I do prize it at my love before</li>
  <li class="number">The reverend’st throat in Athens. So I leave you</li>
