  <li class="number">Suffolk, arise. Welcome, Queen Margaret,</li>

  <li class="number">Brave peers of England, pillars of the state,</li>
  <li class="number">To you Duke Humphrey must unload his grief,</li>
  <li class="number">Your grief, the common grief of all the land.</li>
  <li class="number">What? Did my brother Henry spend his youth,</li>
  <li class="number">His valor, coin, and people, in the wars?</li>
  <li class="number">Did he so often lodge in open field,</li>
  <li class="number">In winter’s cold and summer’s parching heat,</li>
  <li class="number">To conquer France, his true inheritance?</li>
  <li class="number">And did my brother Bedford toil his wits,</li>
  <li class="number">To keep by policy what Henry got?</li>
  <li class="number">Have you yourselves, Somerset, Buckingham,</li>
  <li class="number">Brave York, Salisbury, and victorious Warwick,</li>
  <li class="number">Receiv’d deep scars in France and Normandy?</li>
  <li class="number">Or hath mine uncle Beauford and myself,</li>
  <li class="number">With all the learned Council of the realm,</li>
  <li class="number">Studied so long, sat in the Council-house</li>
  <li class="number">Early and late, debating to and fro</li>
  <li class="number">How France and Frenchmen might be kept in awe,</li>
  <li class="number">And hath his Highness in his infancy</li>
  <li class="number">Crowned in Paris in despite of foes?</li>
  <li class="number">And shall these labors and these honors die?</li>
  <li class="number">Shall Henry’s conquest, Bedford’s vigilance,</li>
  <li class="number">Your deeds of war, and all our counsel die?</li>
  <li class="number">O peers of England, shameful is this league,</li>
  <li class="number">Fatal this marriage, cancelling your fame,</li>
  <li class="number">Blotting your names from books of memory,</li>
  <li class="number">Rasing the characters of your renown,</li>
  <li class="number">Defacing monuments of conquer’d France,</li>
  <li class="number">Undoing all, as all had never been!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAR.">
  <li class="number">Nephew, what means this passionate discourse,</li>
  <li class="number">This peroration with such circumstance?</li>
  <li class="number">For France, ’tis ours; and we will keep it still.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li class="number">Ay, uncle, we will keep it, if we can;</li>
  <li class="number">But now it is impossible we should.</li>
  <li class="number">Suffolk, the new-made duke that rules the roast,</li>
  <li class="number">Hath given the duchy of Anjou, and Maine,</li>
  <li class="number">Unto the poor King Reignier, whose large style</li>
  <li class="number">Agrees not with the leanness of his purse.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SAL.">
  <li class="number">Now by the death of Him that died for all,</li>
  <li class="number">These counties were the keys of Normandy.</li>
  <li class="number">But wherefore weeps Warwick, my valiant son?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WAR.">
  <li class="number">For grief that they are past recovery;</li>
  <li class="number">For were there hope to conquer them again,</li>
  <li class="number">My sword should shed hot blood, mine eyes no tears.</li>
  <li class="number">Anjou and Maine? Myself did win them both.</li>
  <li class="number">Those provinces these arms of mine did conquer,</li>
  <li class="number">And are the cities that I got with wounds</li>
  <li class="number">Deliver’d up again with peaceful words?</li>

<ol data-speaker="YORK.">
  <li class="number">For Suffolk’s duke, may he be suffocate,</li>
  <li class="number">That dims the honor of this warlike isle!</li>
  <li class="number">France should have torn and rent my very heart</li>
  <li class="number">Before I would have yielded to this league.</li>
  <li class="number">I never read but England’s kings have had</li>
  <li class="number">Large sums of gold and dowries with their wives,</li>
  <li class="number">And our King Henry gives away his own,</li>
  <li class="number">To match with her that brings no vantages.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li class="number">A proper jest, and never heard before,</li>
  <li class="number">That Suffolk should demand a whole fifteenth</li>
  <li class="number">For costs and charges in transporting her!</li>
  <li class="number">She should have stay’d in France, and starv’d in France,</li>
  <li class="number">Before—</li>

  <li class="number">’Tis known to you he is mine enemy;</li>
  <li class="number">Nay more, an enemy unto you all,</li>
  <li class="number">And no great friend, I fear me, to the King.</li>
  <li class="number">Consider, lords, he is the next of blood,</li>
  <li class="number">And heir-apparent to the English crown.</li>
  <li class="number">Had Henry got an empire by his marriage,</li>
  <li class="number">And all the wealthy kingdoms of the west,</li>
  <li class="number">There’s reason he should be displeas’d at it.</li>
  <li class="number">Look to it, lords, let not his smoothing words</li>
  <li class="number">Bewitch your hearts. Be wise and circumspect.</li>
  <li class="number">What though the common people favor him,</li>
  <li class="number">Calling him “Humphrey, the good Duke of Gloucester,”</li>
  <li class="number">Clapping their hands, and crying with loud voice,</li>
  <li class="number">“Jesu maintain your royal Excellence!”</li>
  <li class="number">With “God preserve the good Duke Humphrey!”</li>
  <li class="number">I fear me, lords, for all this flattering gloss,</li>

  <li class="number">Nor hold the sceptre in his childish fist,</li>
  <li class="number">Nor wear the diadem upon his head,</li>
  <li class="number">Whose church-like humors fits not for a crown.</li>
  <li class="number">Then, York, be still awhile, till time do serve.</li>
  <li class="number">Watch thou, and wake when others be asleep,</li>
  <li class="number">To pry into the secrets of the state,</li>
  <li class="number">Till Henry, surfeiting in joys of love</li>
  <li class="number">With his new bride and England’s dear-bought queen,</li>
  <li class="number">And Humphrey with the peers be fall’n at jars:</li>
  <li class="number">Then will I raise aloft the milk-white rose,</li>
  <li class="number">With whose sweet smell the air shall be perfum’d,</li>
  <li class="number">And in my standard bear the arms of York,</li>
  <li class="number">To grapple with the house of Lancaster;</li>

</div>

<ol data-speaker="YORK.">
  <li class="number">Now, my good Lords of Salisbury and Warwick,</li>
  <li class="number">Our simple supper ended, give me leave</li>
  <li class="number">In this close walk to satisfy myself</li>
  <li class="number">In craving your opinion of my title,</li>
  <li class="number">Which is infallible, to England’s crown.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SAL.">
  <li class="number">My lord, I long to hear it at full.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WAR.">
  <li class="number">Sweet York, begin; and if thy claim be good,</li>
  <li class="number">The Nevils are thy subjects to command.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="YORK.">
  <li class="number">Then thus:</li>
  <li class="number">Edward the Third, my lords, had seven sons:</li>
  <li class="number">The first, Edward the Black Prince, Prince of Wales;</li>
  <li class="number">The second, William of Hatfield; and the third,</li>
  <li class="number">Lionel Duke of Clarence; next to whom</li>
  <li class="number">Was John of Gaunt, the Duke of Lancaster;</li>
  <li class="number">The fifth was Edmund Langley, Duke of York;</li>
  <li class="number">The sixth was Thomas of Woodstock, Duke of Gloucester;</li>
  <li class="number">William of Windsor was the seventh and last.</li>
  <li class="number">Edward the Black Prince died before his father,</li>
  <li class="number">And left behind him Richard, his only son,</li>
  <li class="number">Who after Edward the Third’s death reign’d as king</li>
  <li class="number">Till Henry Bullingbrook, Duke of Lancaster,</li>
  <li class="number">The eldest son and heir of John of Gaunt,</li>
  <li class="number">Crown’d by the name of Henry the Fourth,</li>
  <li class="number">Seiz’d on the realm, depos’d the rightful king,</li>
  <li class="number">Sent his poor queen to France, from whence she came,</li>
  <li class="number">And him to Pomfret; where, as all you know,</li>
  <li class="number">Harmless Richard was murdered traitorously.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WAR.">
  <li class="number">Father, the Duke hath told the truth;</li>
  <li class="number">Thus got the house of Lancaster the crown.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="YORK.">
  <li class="number">Which now they hold by force and not by right;</li>
  <li class="number">For Richard, the first son’s heir, being dead,</li>
  <li class="number">The issue of the next son should have reign’d.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SAL.">
  <li class="number">But William of Hatfield died without an heir.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="YORK.">
  <li class="number">The third son, Duke of Clarence, from whose line</li>
  <li class="number">I claim the crown, had issue, Philippe, a daughter,</li>
  <li class="number">Who married Edmund Mortimer, Earl of March;</li>
  <li class="number">Edmund had issue, Roger Earl of March;</li>
  <li class="number">Roger had issue, Edmund, Anne, and Eleanor.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SAL.">
  <li class="number">This Edmund, in the reign of Bullingbrook,</li>
  <li class="number">As I have read, laid claim unto the crown,</li>
  <li class="number">And but for Owen Glendower, had been king,</li>
  <li class="number">Who kept him in captivity till he died.</li>
  <li class="number">But, to the rest.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="YORK.">
  <li class="number">His eldest sister, Anne,</li>
  <li class="number">My mother, being heir unto the crown,</li>
  <li class="number">Married Richard Earl of Cambridge, who was</li>
  <li class="number">To Edmund Langley, Edward the Third’s fifth son, son.</li>
  <li class="number">By her I claim the kingdom. She was heir</li>
  <li class="number">To Roger Earl of March, who was the son</li>
  <li class="number">Of Edmund Mortimer, who married Philippe,</li>
  <li class="number">Sole daughter unto Lionel Duke of Clarence;</li>
  <li class="number">So, if the issue of the elder son</li>
  <li class="number">Succeed before the younger, I am king.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WAR.">
  <li class="number">What plain proceedings is more plain than this?</li>
  <li class="number">Henry doth claim the crown from John of Gaunt,</li>
  <li class="number">The fourth son, York claims it from the third;</li>
  <li class="number">Till Lionel’s issue fails, his should not reign.</li>
  <li class="number">It fails not yet, but flourishes in thee,</li>
  <li class="number">And in thy sons, fair slips of such a stock.</li>
  <li class="number">Then, father Salisbury, kneel we together,</li>
  <li class="number">And in this private plot be we the first</li>
  <li class="number">That shall salute our rightful sovereign</li>
  <li class="number">With honor of his birthright to the crown.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BOTH. WAR. AND SAL.">
  <li class="number">Long live our sovereign Richard, England’s king!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="YORK.">
  <li class="number">We thank you, lords. But I am not your king</li>
  <li class="number">Till I be crown’d, and that my sword be stain’d</li>
  <li class="number">With heart-blood of the house of Lancaster;</li>
  <li class="number">And that’s not suddenly to be perform’d,</li>
  <li class="number">But with advice and silent secrecy.</li>
  <li class="number">Do you as I do in these dangerous days:</li>
  <li class="number">Wink at the Duke of Suffolk’s insolence,</li>
  <li class="number">At Beauford’s pride, at Somerset’s ambition,</li>
  <li class="number">At Buckingham, and all the crew of them,</li>
  <li class="number">Till they have snar’d the shepherd of the flock,</li>
  <li class="number">That virtuous prince, the good Duke Humphrey.</li>
  <li class="number">’Tis that they seek; and they in seeking that</li>
  <li class="number">Shall find their deaths, if York can prophesy.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SAL.">
  <li class="number">My lord, break we off; we know your mind at full.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WAR.">
  <li class="number">My heart assures me that the Earl of Warwick</li>
  <li class="number">Shall one day make the Duke of York a king.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="YORK.">
  <li class="number">And, Nevil, this I do assure myself,</li>

  <li class="number">When every one will give the time of day,</li>
  <li class="number">He knits his brow and shows an angry eye,</li>

  <li class="number">Disdaining duty that to us belongs.</li>
  <li class="number">Small curs are not regarded when they grin,</li>

  <li class="number">Me seemeth then it is no policy,</li>
  <li class="number">Respecting what a rancorous mind he bears</li>
  <li class="number">And his advantage following your decease,</li>
  <li class="number">That he should come about your royal person,</li>
  <li class="number">Or be admitted to your Highness’ Council.</li>
  <li class="number">By flattery hath he won the commons’ hearts;</li>

  <li class="number">The reverent care I bear unto my lord</li>

  <li class="number">If it be fond, call it a woman’s fear;</li>

  <li class="number">As next the King he was successive heir,</li>

  <li class="number">By wicked means to frame our sovereign’s fall.</li>
  <li class="number">Smooth runs the water where the brook is deep,</li>
  <li class="number">And in his simple show he harbors treason.</li>
  <li class="number">The fox barks not when he would steal the lamb.</li>
  <li class="number">No, no, my sovereign, Gloucester is a man</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li class="number">Is it but thought so? What are they that think it?</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li class="number">Why, ’tis well known that, whiles I was Protector,</li>
  <li class="number">Pity was all the fault that was in me;</li>

  <li class="number">And lowly words were ransom for their fault.</li>
  <li class="number">Unless it were a bloody murderer,</li>
  <li class="number">Or foul felonious thief that fleec’d poor passengers,</li>
  <li class="number">I never gave them condign punishment.</li>

  <li class="number">But mine is made the prologue to their play;</li>
  <li class="number">For thousands more, that yet suspect no peril,</li>

  <li class="number">Beauford’s red sparkling eyes blab his heart’s malice,</li>

  <li class="number">Myself had notice of your conventicles—</li>

  <li class="number">I shall not want false witness to condemn me,</li>

Wherefore, on a brick wall have I climb’d into this garden, to see if I can eat grass, or pick a sallet another while, which is not amiss to cool a man’s stomach this hot weather. And I think this word ’sallet’ was born to do me good; for many a time, but for a sallet, my brain-pan had been cleft with a brown bill; and many a time, when I have been dry and bravely marching, it hath serv’d me instead of a quart pot to drink in; and now the word ‘sallet’ must serve me to feed on.</li>
