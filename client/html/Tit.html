  <li class="number">Renowmed Lucius, from our troops I stray’d</li>

  <li class="number">And as I earnestly did fix mine eye</li>
  <li class="number">Upon the wasted building, suddenly</li>
  <li class="number">I heard a child cry underneath a wall.</li>
  <li class="number">I made unto the noise, when soon I heard</li>
  <li class="number">The crying babe controll’d with this discourse:</li>
  <li class="number">“Peace, tawny slave, half me and half thy dame.</li>
  <li class="number">Did not thy hue bewray whose brat thou art,</li>
  <li class="number">Had nature lent thee but thy mother’s look,</li>
  <li class="number">Villain, thou mightst have been an emperor.</li>
  <li class="number">But where the bull and cow are both milk-white,</li>
  <li class="number">They never do beget a coal-black calf.</li>
  <li class="number">Peace, villain, peace!”—even thus he rates the babe—</li>
  <li class="number">“For I must bear thee to a trusty Goth,</li>
  <li class="number">Who, when he knows thou art the Empress’ babe,</li>
  <li class="number">Will hold thee dearly for thy mother’s sake.”</li>
  <li class="number">With this, my weapon drawn, I rush’d upon him,</li>
  <li class="number">Surpris’d him suddenly, and brought him hither</li>
  <li class="number">To use as you think needful of the man.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUC.">
  <li class="number">O worthy Goth, this is the incarnate devil</li>
  <li class="number">That robb’d Andronicus of his good hand;</li>
  <li class="number">This is the pearl that pleas’d your empress’ eye,</li>
  <li class="number">And here’s the base fruit of her burning lust.</li>

<ol data-speaker="AAR.">
  <li class="number">Tut, Lucius, this was but a deed of charity</li>
  <li class="number">To that which thou shalt hear of me anon.</li>
  <li class="number">’Twas her two sons that murdered Bassianus;</li>
  <li class="number">They cut thy sister’s tongue, and ravish’d her,</li>
  <li class="number">And cut her hands, and trimm’d her as thou sawest.</li>

  <li class="number">O detestable villain, call’st thou that trimming?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="AAR.">

<ol data-speaker="LUC.">
  <li class="number">O barbarous, beastly villains like thyself!</li>

  <li class="number">As sure a card as ever won the set;</li>
  <li class="number">That bloody mind I think they learn’d of me,</li>
  <li class="number">As true a dog as ever fought at head.</li>
  <li class="number">Well, let my deeds be witness of my worth:</li>
  <li class="number">I train’d thy brethren to that guileful hole,</li>
  <li class="number">Where the dead corpse of Bassianus lay;</li>
  <li class="number">I wrote the letter that thy father found,</li>
  <li class="number">And hid the gold within that letter mentioned,</li>
  <li class="number">Confederate with the Queen and her two sons;</li>
  <li class="number">And what not done, that thou hast cause to rue,</li>
  <li class="number">Wherein I had no stroke of mischief in it?</li>
  <li class="number">I play’d the cheater for thy father’s hand,</li>
  <li class="number">And when I had it, drew myself apart,</li>
  <li class="number">And almost broke my heart with extreme laughter.</li>
  <li class="number">I pried me through the crevice of a wall,</li>
  <li class="number">When, for his hand, he had his two sons’ heads,</li>
  <li class="number">Beheld his tears, and laugh’d so heartily</li>
  <li class="number">That both mine eyes were rainy like to his;</li>
  <li class="number">And when I told the Empress of this sport,</li>
  <li class="number">She sounded almost at my pleasing tale,</li>
  <li class="number">And for my tidings gave me twenty kisses.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. GOTH.">
  <li class="number">What, canst thou say all this and never blush?</li>

<ol data-speaker="AAR.">
  <li class="number">Ay, like a black dog, as the saying is.</li>

<ol data-speaker="LUC.">

  <li class="number">Ay, that I had not done a thousand more.</li>
  <li class="number">Even now I curse the day—and yet I think</li>
  <li class="number">Few come within the compass of my curse—</li>
  <li class="number">Wherein I did not some notorious ill:</li>
  <li class="number">As kill a man, or else devise his death,</li>
  <li class="number">Ravish a maid, or plot the way to do it,</li>
  <li class="number">Accuse some innocent, and forswear myself,</li>
  <li class="number">Set deadly enmity between two friends,</li>
  <li class="number">Make poor men’s cattle break their necks,</li>
  <li class="number">Set fire on barns and haystalks in the night,</li>
  <li class="number">And bid the owners quench them with their tears.</li>
  <li class="number">Oft have I digg’d up dead men from their graves,</li>
  <li class="number">And set them upright at their dear friends’ door,</li>
  <li class="number">Even when their sorrows almost was forgot,</li>
  <li class="number">And on their skins, as on the bark of trees,</li>
  <li class="number">Have with my knife carved in Roman letters,</li>
  <li class="number">“Let not your sorrow die, though I am dead.”</li>
  <li class="number">But I have done a thousand dreadful things,</li>
  <li class="number">As willingly as one would kill a fly,</li>
