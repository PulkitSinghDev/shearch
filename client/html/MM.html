<ol data-speaker="DUKE.">
  <li class="number">Of government the properties to unfold</li>
  <li class="number">Would seem in me t’ affect speech and discourse,</li>
  <li class="number">Since I am put to know that your own science</li>
  <li class="number">Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice</li>
  <li class="number">My strength can give you. Then no more remains</li>
  <li class="number">But that, to your sufficiency, as your worth is able,</li>
  <li class="number">And let them work. The nature of our people,</li>
  <li class="number">Our city’s institutions, and the terms</li>
  <li class="number">For common justice, y’ are as pregnant in</li>
  <li class="number">As art and practice hath enriched any</li>
  <li class="number">That we remember. There is our commission,</li>
  <li class="number">From which we would not have you warp. Call hither,</li>
  <li class="number">I say, bid come before us Angelo.</li>

</li>
  <li class="number">What figure of us think you he will bear?</li>
  <li class="number">For you must know, we have with special soul</li>
  <li class="number">Elected him our absence to supply,</li>
  <li class="number">Lent him our terror, dress’d him with our love,</li>
  <li class="number">And given his deputation all the organs</li>
  <li class="number">Of our own pow’r. What think you of it?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ESCAL.">
  <li class="number">If any in Vienna be of worth</li>
  <li class="number">To undergo such ample grace and honor,</li>
  <li class="number">It is Lord Angelo.</li>

<ol data-speaker="ANG.">
  <li class="number">Always obedient to your Grace’s will,</li>
  <li class="number">I come to know your pleasure.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE.">
  <li class="number">Angelo:</li>
  <li class="number">There is a kind of character in thy life,</li>
  <li class="number">That to th’ observer doth thy history</li>
  <li class="number">Fully unfold. Thyself and thy belongings</li>
  <li class="number">Are not thine own so proper as to waste</li>
  <li class="number">Thyself upon thy virtues, they on thee.</li>
  <li class="number">Heaven doth with us as we with torches do,</li>
  <li class="number">Not light them for themselves; for if our virtues</li>
  <li class="number">Did not go forth of us, ’twere all alike</li>
  <li class="number">As if we had them not. Spirits are not finely touch’d</li>
  <li class="number">But to fine issues; nor Nature never lends</li>
  <li class="number">The smallest scruple of her excellence,</li>
  <li class="number">But like a thrifty goddess, she determines</li>
  <li class="number">Herself the glory of a creditor,</li>
  <li class="number">Both thanks and use. But I do bend my speech</li>
  <li class="number">To one that can my part in him advertise.</li>
  <li class="number">Hold therefore, Angelo:</li>
  <li class="number">In our remove be thou at full ourself.</li>
  <li class="number">Mortality and mercy in Vienna</li>
  <li class="number">Live in thy tongue and heart. Old Escalus,</li>
  <li class="number">Though first in question, is thy secondary.</li>
  <li class="number">Take thy commission.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANG.">
  <li class="number">Now, good my lord,</li>
  <li class="number">Let there be some more test made of my mettle</li>
  <li class="number">Before so noble and so great a figure</li>
  <li class="number">Be stamp’d upon it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE.">
  <li class="number">No more evasion.</li>
  <li class="number">We have with a leaven’d and prepared choice</li>
  <li class="number">Proceeded to you; therefore take your honors.</li>
  <li class="number">Our haste from hence is of so quick condition</li>
  <li class="number">That it prefers itself, and leaves unquestion’d</li>
  <li class="number">Matters of needful value. We shall write to you,</li>
  <li class="number">As time and our concernings shall importune,</li>
  <li class="number">How it goes with us, and do look to know</li>
  <li class="number">What doth befall you here. So fare you well.</li>
  <li class="number">To th’ hopeful execution do I leave you</li>
  <li class="number">Of your commissions.</li>

  <li class="number">Yet give leave, my lord,</li>
  <li class="number">That we may bring you something on the way.</li>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE.">
  <li class="number">My haste may not admit it,</li>
  <li class="number">Nor need you (on mine honor) have to do</li>
  <li class="number">With any scruple. Your scope is as mine own,</li>
  <li class="number">So to enforce or qualify the laws</li>
  <li class="number">As to your soul seems good. Give me your hand,</li>
  <li class="number">I’ll privily away. I love the people,</li>
  <li class="number">But do not like to stage me to their eyes;</li>
  <li class="number">Though it do well, I do not relish well</li>
  <li class="number">Their loud applause and aves vehement;</li>
  <li class="number">Nor do I think the man of safe discretion</li>
  <li class="number">That does affect it. Once more fare you well.</li>

  <li class="number">The heavens give safety to your purposes!</li>

<h3>Scene 2</h3>

<h4>Vienna. A street.</h4>

<div class="stage-direction">
	Enter Lucio and two other Gentlemen.
	
		LUCIO.
		1. GENT.
		2. GENT.
	
</div>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIO.">
  <li class="number">If the Duke with the other dukes come not to composition with the King of Hungary, why then all the dukes fall upon the King.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. GENT.">
  <li class="number">Heaven grant us its peace, but not the King of Hungary’s!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="2. GENT.">
  <li class="number">Amen.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIO.">
  <li class="number">Thou conclud’st like the sanctimonious pirate, that went to sea with the Ten Commandments, but scrap’d one out of the table.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="2. GENT.">
  <li class="number">“Thou shalt not steal”?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIO.">
  <li class="number">Ay, that he raz’d.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. GENT.">
  <li class="number">Why, ’twas a commandment to command the captain and all the rest from their functions; they put forth to steal. There’s not a soldier of us all, that in the thanksgiving before meat, do relish the petition well that prays for peace.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="2. GENT.">
  <li class="number">I never heard any soldier dislike it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIO.">
  <li class="number">I believe thee; for I think thou never wast where grace was said.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="2. GENT.">
  <li class="number">No? A dozen times at least.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. GENT.">
  <li class="number">What? In metre?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIO.">
  <li class="number">In any proportion, or in any language.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. GENT.">
  <li class="number">I think, or in any religion.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIO.">
  <li class="number">Ay, why not? Grace is grace, despite of all controversy; as for example, thou thyself art a wicked villain, despite of all grace.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. GENT.">
  <li class="number">Well; there went but a pair of shears between us.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIO.">
  <li class="number">I grant; as there may between the lists and the velvet. Thou art the list.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. GENT.">
  <li class="number">And thou the velvet—thou art good velvet; thou’rt a three-pil’d piece, I warrant thee. I had as lief be a list of an English kersey as be pil’d, as thou art pil’d, for a French velvet. Do I speak feelingly now?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIO.">
  <li class="number">I think thou dost; and indeed with most painful feeling of thy speech. I will, out of thine own confession, learn to begin thy health; but, whilst I live, forget to drink after thee.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. GENT.">
  <li class="number">I think I have done myself wrong, have I not?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="2. GENT.">
  <li class="number">Yes, that thou hast; whether thou art tainted or free.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">

  <li class="number">To three thousand dolors a year.</li>

<ol data-speaker="1. GENT.">
  <li class="number">Ay, and more.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIO.">
  <li class="number">A French crown more.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. GENT.">
  <li class="number">Thou art always figuring diseases in me; but thou art full of error, I am sound.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIO.">
  <li class="number">Nay, not (as one would say) healthy; but so sound as things that are hollow.</li>
  <li class="number">Thy bones are hollow; impiety has made a feast of thee.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. GENT.">
  <li class="number">How now, which of your hips has the most profound sciatica?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MRS. OV.">
  <li class="number">Well, well; there’s one yonder arrested and carried to prison was worth five thousand of you all.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="2. GENT.">
  <li class="number">Who’s that, I pray thee?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MRS. OV.">
  <li class="number">Marry, sir, that’s Claudio, <foreign xml:lang="it">Signior</foreign> Claudio.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. GENT.">
  <li class="number">Claudio to prison? ’Tis not so.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MRS. OV.">
  <li class="number">Nay, but I know ’tis so. I saw him arrested; saw him carried away; and which is more, within these three days his head to be chopp’d off.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIO.">
  <li class="number">But after all this fooling, I would not have it so. Art thou sure of this?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MRS. OV.">
  <li class="number">I am too sure of it; and it is for getting Madam Julietta with child.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIO.">
  <li class="number">Believe me, this may be. He promis’d to meet me two hours since, and he was ever precise in promise-keeping.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="2. GENT.">
  <li class="number">Besides, you know, it draws something near to the speech we had to such a purpose.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. GENT.">
  <li class="number">But most of all agreeing with the proclamation.</li>

  <li class="number">No; but there’s a woman with maid by him. You have not heard of the proclamation, have you?</li>

  <li class="number">What proclamation, man?</li>

<ol data-speaker="POM.">
  <li class="number">All houses in the suburbs of Vienna must be pluck’d down.</li>

<ol data-speaker="MRS. OV.">
  <li class="number">And what shall become of those in the city?</li>

<ol data-speaker="POM.">
  <li class="number">They shall stand for seed. They had gone down too, but that a wise burgher put in for them.</li>

<ol data-speaker="MRS. OV.">
  <li class="number">But shall all our houses of resort in the suburbs be pull’d down?</li>

<ol data-speaker="POM.">
  <li class="number">Come; fear not you; good counsellors lack no clients. Though you change your place, you need not change your trade; I’ll be your tapster still. Courage! There will be pity taken on you. You that have worn your eyes almost out in the service, you will be consider’d.</li>

</div>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIO.">
  <li class="number">Why, how now, Claudio? Whence comes this restraint?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLAUD.">
  <li class="number">From too much liberty, my Lucio, liberty:</li>
  <li class="number">As surfeit is the father of much fast,</li>
  <li class="number">So every scope by the immoderate use</li>
  <li class="number">Turns to restraint. Our natures do pursue,</li>
  <li class="number">Like rats that ravin down their proper bane,</li>
  <li class="number">A thirsty evil, and when we drink we die.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIO.">
  <li class="number">If I could speak so wisely under an arrest, I would send for certain of my creditors; and yet, to say the truth, I had as lief have the foppery of freedom as the mortality of imprisonment. What’s thy offense, Claudio?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLAUD.">
  <li class="number">What but to speak of would offend again.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIO.">
  <li class="number">What, is’t murder?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLAUD.">
  <li class="number">No.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIO.">
  <li class="number">Lechery?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLAUD.">
  <li class="number">Call it so.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PROV.">
  <li class="number">Away, sir, you must go.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLAUD.">
  <li class="number">One word, good friend. Lucio, a word with you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIO.">
  <li class="number">A hundred! If they’ll do you any good.</li>
  <li class="number">Is lechery so look’d after?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLAUD.">
  <li class="number">Thus stands it with me: upon a true contract</li>
  <li class="number">I got possession of Julietta’s bed.</li>
  <li class="number">You know the lady; she is fast my wife,</li>
  <li class="number">Save that we do the denunciation lack</li>
  <li class="number">Of outward order. This we came not to,</li>
  <li class="number">Only for propagation of a dow’r</li>
  <li class="number">Remaining in the coffer of her friends,</li>
  <li class="number">From whom we thought it meet to hide our love</li>
  <li class="number">Till time had made them for us. But it chances</li>
  <li class="number">The stealth of our most mutual entertainment</li>
  <li class="number">With character too gross is writ on Juliet.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIO.">
  <li class="number">With child, perhaps?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLAUD.">
  <li class="number">Unhappily, even so.</li>
  <li class="number">And the new deputy now for the Duke—</li>
  <li class="number">Whether it be the fault and glimpse of newness,</li>
  <li class="number">Or whether that the body public be</li>
  <li class="number">A horse whereon the governor doth ride,</li>
  <li class="number">Who, newly in the seat, that it may know</li>
  <li class="number">He can command, lets it straight feel the spur;</li>
  <li class="number">Whether the tyranny be in his place,</li>
  <li class="number">Or in his eminence that fills it up,</li>
  <li class="number">I stagger in—but this new governor</li>
  <li class="number">Awakes me all the enrolled penalties</li>
  <li class="number">Which have, like unscour’d armor, hung by th’ wall</li>
  <li class="number">So long that nineteen zodiacs have gone round</li>
  <li class="number">And none of them been worn; and for a name</li>
  <li class="number">Now puts the drowsy and neglected act</li>
  <li class="number">Freshly on me—’tis surely for a name.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIO.">
  <li class="number">I warrant it is; and thy head stands so tickle on thy shoulders that a milkmaid, if she be in love, may sigh it off. Send after the Duke, and appeal to him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLAUD.">
  <li class="number">I have done so, but he’s not to be found.</li>
  <li class="number">I prithee, Lucio, do me this kind service:</li>
  <li class="number">This day my sister should the cloister enter,</li>
  <li class="number">And there receive her approbation.</li>
  <li class="number">Acquaint her with the danger of my state;</li>
  <li class="number">Implore her, in my voice, that she make friends</li>
  <li class="number">To the strict deputy; bid herself assay him.</li>
  <li class="number">I have great hope in that; for in her youth</li>
  <li class="number">There is a prone and speechless dialect,</li>
  <li class="number">Such as move men; beside, she hath prosperous art</li>
  <li class="number">When she will play with reason and discourse,</li>
  <li class="number">And well she can persuade.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIO.">
  <li class="number">I pray she may; as well for the encouragement of the like, which else would stand under grievous imposition, as for the enjoying of thy life, who I would be sorry should be thus foolishly lost at a game of tick-tack. I’ll to her.</li>

  <li class="number">Becomes more mock’d than fear’d; so our decrees,</li>
  <li class="number">Dead to infliction, to themselves are dead,</li>
  <li class="number">And liberty plucks justice by the nose;</li>
  <li class="number">The baby beats the nurse, and quite athwart</li>
  <li class="number">Goes all decorum.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FRI. PET.">
  <li class="number">It rested in your Grace</li>
  <li class="number">To unloose this tied-up justice when you pleas’d:</li>
  <li class="number">And it in you more dreadful would have seem’d</li>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE.">
  <li class="number">I do fear—too dreadful;</li>
  <li class="number">Sith ’twas my fault to give the people scope,</li>
  <li class="number">’Twould be my tyranny to strike and gall them</li>
  <li class="number">For what I bid them do; for we bid this be done,</li>
  <li class="number">When evil deeds have their permissive pass,</li>
  <li class="number">And not the punishment. Therefore indeed, my father,</li>
  <li class="number">I have on Angelo impos’d the office,</li>
  <li class="number">Who may, in th’ ambush of my name, strike home,</li>
  <li class="number">And yet my nature never in the fight</li>
  <li class="number">To do in slander. And to behold his sway,</li>
  <li class="number">I will, as ’twere a brother of your order,</li>
  <li class="number">Visit both prince and people; therefore I prithee</li>
  <li class="number">Supply me with the habit, and instruct me</li>
  <li class="number">How I may formally in person bear</li>
  <li class="number">Like a true friar. More reasons for this action</li>
  <li class="number">At our more leisure shall I render you;</li>
  <li class="number">Only, this one: Lord Angelo is precise;</li>
  <li class="number">Stands at a guard with envy; scarce confesses</li>
  <li class="number">That his blood flows; or that his appetite</li>
  <li class="number">Is more to bread than stone: hence shall we see</li>
  <li class="number">If power change purpose: what our seemers be.</li>

  <li class="number">’Tis true.</li>

  <li class="number">You do blaspheme the good in mocking me.</li>

  <li class="number">Do not believe it. Fewness and truth, ’tis thus:</li>

  <li class="number">As those that feed grow full, as blossoming time</li>
  <li class="number">That from the seedness the bare fallow brings</li>

  <li class="number">This is the point.</li>

  <li class="number">Bore many gentlemen (myself being one)</li>
  <li class="number">In hand, and hope of action; but we do learn</li>
  <li class="number">By those that know the very nerves of state,</li>
  <li class="number">His givings-out were of an infinite distance</li>
  <li class="number">From his true-meant design. Upon his place,</li>
  <li class="number">And with full line of his authority,</li>
  <li class="number">Governs Lord Angelo, a man whose blood</li>
  <li class="number">Is very snow-broth; one who never feels</li>
  <li class="number">The wanton stings and motions of the sense;</li>
  <li class="number">But doth rebate and blunt his natural edge</li>
  <li class="number">With profits of the mind: study and fast.</li>
  <li class="number">He (to give fear to use and liberty,</li>
  <li class="number">Which have for long run by the hideous law,</li>
  <li class="number">As mice by lions) hath pick’d out an act,</li>
  <li class="number">Under whose heavy sense your brother’s life</li>
  <li class="number">Falls into forfeit; he arrests him on it,</li>
  <li class="number">And follows close the rigor of the statute,</li>
  <li class="number">To make him an example. All hope is gone,</li>
  <li class="number">Unless you have the grace by your fair prayer</li>
  <li class="number">To soften Angelo. And that’s my pith</li>
  <li class="number">Of business ’twixt you and your poor brother.</li>

  <li class="number">Doth he so seek his life?</li>

  <li class="number">My power? Alas, I doubt—</li>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIO.">
  <li class="number">Our doubts are traitors,</li>

  <li class="number">By fearing to attempt. Go to Lord Angelo,</li>
  <li class="number">And let him learn to know, when maidens sue,</li>
  <li class="number">Men give like gods; but when they weep and kneel,</li>
  <li class="number">All their petitions are as freely theirs</li>

  <li class="number">We must not make a scarecrow of the law,</li>

  <li class="number">Ay, but yet</li>

  <li class="number">The jewel that we find, we stoop and take’t,</li>
  <li class="number">Because we see it; but what we do not see</li>
  <li class="number">We tread upon, and never think of it.</li>
  <li class="number">You may not so extenuate his offense</li>

  <li class="number">Nay, I’ll not warrant that; for I can speak</li>

  <li class="number">I (now the voice of the recorded law)</li>
  <li class="number">Pronounce a sentence on your brother’s life;</li>
  <li class="number">Might there not be a charity in sin</li>
  <li class="number">To save this brother’s life?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ISAB.">
  <li class="number">Please you to do’t,</li>

  <li class="number">It is no sin at all, but charity.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANG.">
  <li class="number">Pleas’d you to do’t at peril of your soul,</li>
  <li class="number">Were equal poise of sin and charity.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ISAB.">
  <li class="number">That I do beg his life, if it be sin,</li>
  <li class="number">Heaven let me bear it! You granting of my suit,</li>
  <li class="number">If that be sin, I’ll make it my morn-prayer</li>
  <li class="number">To have it added to the faults of mine,</li>
  <li class="number">And nothing of your answer.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANG.">
  <li class="number">Nay, but hear me,</li>
  <li class="number">Your sense pursues not mine. Either you are ignorant,</li>
  <li class="number">Or seem so craftily; and that’s not good.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ISAB.">

<ol data-speaker="ANG.">
  <li class="number">Thus wisdom wishes to appear most bright</li>
  <li class="number">When it doth tax itself; as these black masks</li>
  <li class="number">Proclaim an enshield beauty ten times louder</li>
  <li class="number">Than beauty could, displayed. But mark me:</li>
  <li class="number">To be received plain, I’ll speak more gross:</li>
  <li class="number">Your brother is to die.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ISAB.">
  <li class="number">So.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANG.">
  <li class="number">And his offense is so, as it appears,</li>
  <li class="number">Accountant to the law upon that pain.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ISAB.">
  <li class="number">True.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANG.">
  <li class="number">Admit no other way to save his life</li>
  <li class="number">(As I subscribe not that, nor any other,</li>
  <li class="number">But in the loss of question), that you, his sister,</li>
  <li class="number">Finding yourself desir’d of such a person,</li>
  <li class="number">Whose credit with the judge, or own great place,</li>
  <li class="number">Could fetch your brother from the manacles</li>
  <li class="number">Of the all-binding law; and that there were</li>
  <li class="number">No earthly mean to save him, but that either</li>
  <li class="number">You must lay down the treasures of your body</li>
  <li class="number">To this supposed, or else to let him suffer—</li>
  <li class="number">What would you do?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ISAB.">
  <li class="number">As much for my poor brother as myself:</li>
  <li class="number">That is, were I under the terms of death,</li>
  <li class="number">Th’ impression of keen whips I’ld wear as rubies,</li>
  <li class="number">And strip myself to death, as to a bed</li>
  <li class="number">That longing have been sick for, ere I’ld yield</li>
  <li class="number">My body up to shame.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANG.">
  <li class="number">Then must your brother die.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ISAB.">
  <li class="number">And ’twere the cheaper way:</li>
  <li class="number">Better it were a brother died at once,</li>
  <li class="number">Than that a sister, by redeeming him,</li>
  <li class="number">Should die forever.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANG.">
  <li class="number">Were not you then as cruel as the sentence</li>
  <li class="number">That you have slander’d so?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ISAB.">
  <li class="number">Ignomy in ransom and free pardon</li>
  <li class="number">Are of two houses: lawful mercy</li>
  <li class="number">Is nothing kin to foul redemption.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANG.">
  <li class="number">You seem’d of late to make the law a tyrant,</li>
  <li class="number">And rather prov’d the sliding of your brother</li>
  <li class="number">A merriment than a vice.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ISAB.">
  <li class="number">O, pardon me, my lord, it oft falls out,</li>
  <li class="number">To have what we would have, we speak not what we mean.</li>
  <li class="number">I something do excuse the thing I hate,</li>
  <li class="number">For his advantage that I dearly love.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANG.">
  <li class="number">We are all frail.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ISAB.">
  <li class="number">Else let my brother die,</li>
  <li class="number">If not a fedary, but only he,</li>
  <li class="number">Owe and succeed thy weakness.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANG.">
  <li class="number">Nay, women are frail too.</li>

<ol data-speaker="ISAB.">
  <li class="number">Ay, as the glasses where they view themselves,</li>

  <li class="number">Women? Help heaven! Men their creation mar</li>
  <li class="number">In profiting by them. Nay, call us ten times frail,</li>
  <li class="number">For we are soft as our complexions are,</li>

<ol data-speaker="ANG.">
  <li class="number">I think it well;</li>

  <li class="number">That dost this habitation where thou keep’st</li>
  <li class="number">Hourly afflict. Merely, thou art death’s fool,</li>
  <li class="number">For him thou labor’st by thy flight to shun,</li>
  <li class="number">And yet run’st toward him still. Thou art not noble,</li>
  <li class="number">For all th’ accommodations that thou bear’st</li>
  <li class="number">Are nurs’d by baseness. Thou’rt by no means valiant,</li>
  <li class="number">For thou dost fear the soft and tender fork</li>
  <li class="number">Of a poor worm. Thy best of rest is sleep,</li>
  <li class="number">And that thou oft provok’st, yet grossly fear’st</li>
  <li class="number">Thy death, which is no more. Thou art not thyself,</li>
  <li class="number">For thou exists on many a thousand grains</li>
  <li class="number">That issue out of dust. Happy thou art not,</li>
  <li class="number">For what thou hast not, still thou striv’st to get,</li>
  <li class="number">And what thou hast, forget’st. Thou art not certain,</li>
  <li class="number">For thy complexion shifts to strange effects,</li>
  <li class="number">After the moon. If thou art rich, thou’rt poor,</li>
  <li class="number">For like an ass, whose back with ingots bows,</li>
  <li class="number">Thou bear’st thy heavy riches but a journey,</li>
  <li class="number">And death unloads thee. Friend hast thou none,</li>
  <li class="number">For thine own bowels, which do call thee sire,</li>
  <li class="number">The mere effusion of thy proper loins,</li>
  <li class="number">Do curse the gout, serpigo, and the rheum</li>
  <li class="number">For ending thee no sooner. Thou hast nor youth nor age,</li>
  <li class="number">But as it were an after-dinner’s sleep,</li>
  <li class="number">Dreaming on both, for all thy blessed youth</li>
  <li class="number">Becomes as aged, and doth beg the alms</li>
  <li class="number">Of palsied eld; and when thou art old and rich,</li>
  <li class="number">Thou hast neither heat, affection, limb, nor beauty,</li>
  <li class="number">To make thy riches pleasant. What’s yet in this</li>
  <li class="number">That bears the name of life? Yet in this life</li>
  <li class="number">Lie hid more thousand deaths; yet death we fear</li>
  <li class="number">That makes these odds all even.</li>

  <li class="number">Why,</li>

  <li class="number">Lord Angelo, having affairs to heaven,</li>

  <li class="number">None, but such remedy as, to save a head,</li>

  <li class="number">But is there any?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ISAB.">
  <li class="number">Yes, brother, you may live;</li>

<ol data-speaker="CLAUD.">
  <li class="number">Let me know the point.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ISAB.">
  <li class="number">O, I do fear thee, Claudio, and I quake,</li>
  <li class="number">Lest thou a feverous life shouldst entertain,</li>
  <li class="number">And six or seven winters more respect</li>
  <li class="number">Than a perpetual honor. Dar’st thou die?</li>
  <li class="number">The sense of death is most in apprehension,</li>
  <li class="number">And the poor beetle that we tread upon</li>
  <li class="number">In corporal sufferance finds a pang as great</li>
  <li class="number">As when a giant dies.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLAUD.">
  <li class="number">Why give you me this shame?</li>
  <li class="number">Think you I can a resolution fetch</li>

  <li class="number">I will encounter darkness as a bride,</li>
  <li class="number">And hug it in mine arms.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ISAB.">
  <li class="number">There spake my brother; there my father’s grave</li>
  <li class="number">Did utter forth a voice. Yes, thou must die:</li>
  <li class="number">Thou art too noble to conserve a life</li>
  <li class="number">In base appliances. This outward-sainted deputy,</li>
  <li class="number">Whose settled visage and deliberate word</li>
  <li class="number">Nips youth i’ th’ head, and follies doth enew</li>
  <li class="number">As falcon doth the fowl, is yet a devil;</li>
  <li class="number">His filth within being cast, he would appear</li>
  <li class="number">A pond as deep as hell.</li>
</ol>

  <li class="number">The precise Angelo?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ISAB.">
  <li class="number">O, ’tis the cunning livery of hell,</li>
  <li class="number">The damned’st body to invest and cover</li>
  <li class="number">In princely guards! Dost thou think, Claudio,</li>
  <li class="number">If I would yield him my virginity,</li>
  <li class="number">Thou mightst be freed!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLAUD.">
  <li class="number">O heavens, it cannot be.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ISAB.">
  <li class="number">Yes, he would give’t thee, from this rank offense,</li>

  <li class="number">Thou shalt not do’t.</li>

<ol data-speaker="ISAB.">
  <li class="number">O, were it but my life,</li>

<ol data-speaker="CLAUD.">
  <li class="number">Thanks, dear Isabel.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ISAB.">
  <li class="number">Be ready, Claudio, for your death tomorrow.</li>

<ol data-speaker="CLAUD.">
  <li class="number">Yes. Has he affections in him,</li>
  <li class="number">That thus can make him bite the law by th’ nose,</li>
  <li class="number">When he would force it? Sure it is no sin,</li>
  <li class="number">Or of the deadly seven it is the least.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ISAB.">
  <li class="number">Which is the least?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLAUD.">
  <li class="number">If it were damnable, he being so wise,</li>

  <li class="number">A kneaded clod; and the delighted spirit</li>
  <li class="number">To bathe in fiery floods, or to reside</li>
  <li class="number">In thrilling region of thick-ribbed ice;</li>
  <li class="number">To be imprison’d in the viewless winds</li>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE.">
  <li class="number">Son, I have overheard what hath pass’d between you and your sister. Angelo had never the purpose to corrupt her; only he hath made an assay of her virtue to practice his judgment with the disposition of natures. She (having the truth of honor in her) hath made him that gracious denial which he is most glad to receive. I am confessor to Angelo, and I know this to be true; therefore prepare yourself to death. Do not satisfy your resolution with hopes that are fallible, tomorrow you must die; go to your knees, and make ready.</li>

	Turning to Isabella.
	
		DUKE.
	
</li>
  <li class="number">The hand that hath made you fair hath made you good; the goodness that is cheap in beauty makes beauty brief in goodness; but grace, being the soul of your complexion, shall keep the body of it ever fair. The assault that Angelo hath made to you, fortune hath convey’d to my understanding; and but that frailty hath examples for his falling, I should wonder at Angelo. How will you do to content this substitute, and to save your brother?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ISAB.">
  <li class="number">I am now going to resolve him. I had rather my brother die by the law than my son should be unlawfully born. But O, how much is the good Duke deceiv’d in Angelo! If ever he return, and I can speak to him, I will open my lips in vain, or discover his government.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE.">
  <li class="number">That shall not be much amiss; yet, as the matter now stands, he will avoid your accusation: he made trial of you only. Therefore fasten your ear on my advisings: to the love I have in doing good a remedy presents itself. I do make myself believe that you may most uprighteously do a poor wrong’d lady a merited benefit; redeem your brother from the angry law; do no stain to your own gracious person; and much please the absent Duke, if peradventure he shall ever return to have hearing of this business.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ISAB.">
  <li class="number">Let me hear you speak farther. I have spirit to do any thing that appears not foul in the truth of my spirit.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE.">
  <li class="number">Virtue is bold, and goodness never fearful. Have you not heard speak of Mariana, the sister of Frederick, the great soldier who miscarried at sea?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ISAB.">
  <li class="number">I have heard of the lady, and good words went with her name.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE.">
  <li class="number">She should this Angelo have married; was affianc’d to her by oath, and the nuptial appointed; between which time of the contract and limit of the solemnity, her brother Frederick was wrack’d at sea, having in that perish’d vessel the dowry of his sister. But mark how heavily this befell to the poor gentlewoman: there she lost a noble and renown’d brother, in his love toward her ever most kind and natural; with him, the portion and sinew of her fortune, her marriage-dowry; with both, her combinate-husband, this well-seeming Angelo.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ISAB.">
  <li class="number">Can this be so? Did Angelo so leave her?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE.">
  <li class="number">Left her in her tears, and dried not one of them with his comfort; swallow’d his vows whole, pretending in her discoveries of dishonor; in few, bestow’d her on her own lamentation, which she yet wears for his sake; and he, a marble to her tears, is wash’d with them, but relents not.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ISAB.">
  <li class="number">What a merit were it in death to take this poor maid from the world! What corruption in this life, that it will let this man live! But how out of this can she avail?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE.">
  <li class="number">It is a rupture that you may easily heal; and the cure of it not only saves your brother, but keeps you from dishonor in doing it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ISAB.">
  <li class="number">Show me how, good father.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE.">
  <li class="number">This forenam’d maid hath yet in her the continuance of her first affection; his unjust unkindness (that in all reason should have quench’d her love) hath (like an impediment in the current) made it more violent and unruly. Go you to Angelo, answer his requiring with a plausible obedience, agree with his demands to the point; only refer yourself to this advantage: first, that your stay with him may not be long; that the time may have all shadow and silence in it; and the place answer to convenience. This being granted in course—and now follows all—we shall advise this wrong’d maid to stead up your appointment, go in your place. If the encounter acknowledge itself hereafter, it may compel him to her recompense; and here, by this is your brother sav’d, your honor untainted, the poor Mariana advantag’d, and the corrupt deputy scal’d. The maid will I frame, and make fit for his attempt. If you think well to carry this as you may, the doubleness of the benefit defends the deceit from reproof. What think you of it?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ISAB.">
  <li class="number">The image of it gives me content already, and I trust it will grow to a most prosperous perfection.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE.">
  <li class="number">It lies much in your holding up. Haste you speedily to Angelo; if for this night he entreat you to his bed, give him promise of satisfaction. I will presently to Saint Luke’s; there, at the moated grange, resides this dejected Mariana. At that place call upon me, and dispatch with Angelo, that it may be quickly.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ISAB.">
  <li class="number">I thank you for this comfort. Fare you well, good father.</li>

  <li class="number">What news, friar, of the Duke?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE.">
  <li class="number">I know none. Can you tell me of any?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIO.">
  <li class="number">Some say he is with the Emperor of Russia; other some, he is in Rome; but where is he, think you?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE.">
  <li class="number">I know not where; but wheresoever, I wish him well.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIO.">
  <li class="number">It was a mad fantastical trick of him to steal from the state, and usurp the beggary he was never born to. Lord Angelo dukes it well in his absence; he puts transgression to’t.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE.">
  <li class="number">He does well in’t.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIO.">
  <li class="number">A little more lenity to lechery would do no harm in him. Something too crabbed that way, friar.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE.">
  <li class="number">It is too general a vice, and severity must cure it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIO.">
  <li class="number">Yes, in good sooth, the vice is of a great kindred; it is well allied; but it is impossible to extirp it quite, friar, till eating and drinking be put down. They say this Angelo was not made by man and woman after this downright way of creation. Is it true, think you?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE.">
  <li class="number">How should he be made then?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIO.">
  <li class="number">Some report a sea-maid spawn’d him; some, that he was begot between two stock-fishes. But it is certain that when he makes water his urine is congeal’d ice, that I know to be true; and he is a motion generative, that’s infallible.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE.">
  <li class="number">You are pleasant, sir, and speak apace.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIO.">
  <li class="number">Why, what a ruthless thing is this in him, for the rebellion of a codpiece to take away the life of a man! Would the Duke that is absent have done this? Ere he would have hang’d a man for the getting a hundred bastards, he would have paid for the nursing a thousand. He had some feeling of the sport; he knew the service, and that instructed him to mercy.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE.">
  <li class="number">I never heard the absent Duke much detected for women, he was not inclin’d that way.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIO.">
  <li class="number">O, sir, you are deceiv’d.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE.">
  <li class="number">’Tis not possible.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIO.">
  <li class="number">Who? Not the Duke? Yes, your beggar of fifty; and his use was to put a ducat in her clack-dish. The Duke had crotchets in him. He would be drunk too, that let me inform you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE.">
  <li class="number">You do him wrong, surely.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIO.">
  <li class="number">Sir, I was an inward of his. A shy fellow was the Duke, and I believe I know the cause of his withdrawing.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE.">
  <li class="number">What, I prithee, might be the cause?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIO.">
  <li class="number">No, pardon; ’tis a secret must be lock’d within the teeth and the lips. But this I can let you understand, the greater file of the subject held the Duke to be wise.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE.">
  <li class="number">Wise? Why, no question but he was.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIO.">
  <li class="number">A very superficial, ignorant, unweighing fellow.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE.">
  <li class="number">Either this is envy in you, folly, or mistaking. The very stream of his life, and the business he hath helm’d, must, upon a warranted need, give him a better proclamation. Let him be but testimonied in his own bringings-forth, and he shall appear to the envious a scholar, a statesman, and a soldier. Therefore you speak unskillfully; or, if your knowledge be more, it is much dark’ned in your malice.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIO.">
  <li class="number">Sir, I know him, and I love him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE.">
  <li class="number">Love talks with better knowledge, and knowledge with dearer love.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIO.">
  <li class="number">Come, sir, I know what I know.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE.">
  <li class="number">I can hardly believe that, since you know not what you speak. But if ever the Duke return (as our prayers are he may), let me desire you to make your answer before him. If it be honest you have spoke, you have courage to maintain it. I am bound to call upon you, and I pray you your name?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIO.">
  <li class="number">Sir, my name is Lucio, well known to the Duke.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE.">
  <li class="number">He shall know you better, sir, if I may live to report you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIO.">
  <li class="number">I fear you not.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE.">
  <li class="number">O, you hope the Duke will return no more; or you imagine me too unhurtful an opposite. But indeed I can do you little harm; you’ll forswear this again.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIO.">
  <li class="number">I’ll be hang’d first; thou art deceiv’d in me, friar. But no more of this. Canst thou tell if Claudio die tomorrow, or no?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE.">
  <li class="number">Why should he die, sir?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUCIO.">
  <li class="number">Why? For filling a bottle with a tun-dish. I would the Duke we talk of were return’d again. This ungenitur’d agent will unpeople the province with continency. Sparrows must not build in his house-eaves, because they are lecherous. The Duke yet would have dark deeds darkly answer’d, he would never bring them to light. Would he were return’d! Marry, this Claudio is condemn’d for untrussing. Farewell, good friar, I prithee pray for me. The Duke (I say to thee again) would eat mutton on Fridays. He’s now past it, yet (and I say to thee) he would mouth with a beggar, though she smelt brown bread and garlic. Say that I said so. Farewell.</li>

  <li class="number">None, but that there is so great a fever on goodness, that the dissolution of it must cure it. Novelty is only in request, and, as it is, as dangerous to be ag’d in any kind of course, as it is virtuous to be constant in any undertaking. There is scarce truth enough alive to make societies secure, but security enough to make fellowships accurs’d. Much upon this riddle runs the wisdom of the world. This news is old enough, yet it is every day’s news. I pray you, sir, of what disposition was the Duke?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ESCAL.">
  <li class="number">One that, above all other strifes, contended especially to know himself.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE.">
  <li class="number">What pleasure was he given to?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ESCAL.">
  <li class="number">Rather rejoicing to see another merry, than merry at any thing which profess’d to make him rejoice; a gentleman of all temperance. But leave we him to his events, with a prayer they may prove prosperous, and let me desire to know how you find Claudio prepar’d. I am made to understand that you have lent him visitation.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE.">
  <li class="number">He professes to have receiv’d no sinister measure from his judge, but most willingly humbles himself to the determination of justice; yet had he fram’d to himself (by the instruction of his frailty) many deceiving promises of life, which I (by my good leisure) have discredited to him, and now is he resolv’d to die.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ESCAL.">
  <li class="number">You have paid the heavens your function, and the prisoner the very debt of your calling. I have labor’d for the poor gentleman to the extremest shore of my modesty, but my brother-justice have I found so severe, that he hath forc’d me to tell him he is indeed Justice.</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PROV.">
  <li class="number">I told you: Lord Angelo (belike) thinking me remiss in mine office, awakens me with this unwonted putting-on, methinks strangely, for he hath not us’d it before.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE.">
  <li class="number">Pray you let’s hear.</li>

For my better satisfaction, let me have Claudio’s head sent me by five. Let this be duly perform’d, with a thought that more depends on it than we must yet deliver. Thus fail not to do your office, as you will answer it at your peril.” What say you to this, sir?</recite></li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE.">
  <li class="number">What is that Barnardine who is to be executed in th’ afternoon?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PROV.">
  <li class="number">A Bohemian born; but here nurs’d up and bred, one that is a prisoner nine years old.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE.">
  <li class="number">How came it that the absent Duke had not either deliver’d him to his liberty or executed him? I have heard it was ever his manner to do so.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PROV.">
  <li class="number">His friends still wrought reprieves for him; and indeed his fact, till now in the government of Lord Angelo, came not to an undoubtful proof.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE.">
  <li class="number">It is now apparent?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PROV.">
  <li class="number">Most manifest, and not denied by himself.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE.">
  <li class="number">Hath he borne himself penitently in prison? How seems he to be touch’d?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PROV.">
  <li class="number">A man that apprehends death no more dreadfully but as a drunken sleep, careless, reckless, and fearless of what’s past, present, or to come; insensible of mortality, and desperately mortal.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE.">
  <li class="number">He wants advice.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PROV.">
  <li class="number">He will hear none. He hath evermore had the liberty of the prison; give him leave to escape hence, he would not. Drunk many times a day, if not many days entirely drunk. We have very oft awak’d him, as if to carry him to execution, and show’d him a seeming warrant for it; it hath not mov’d him at all.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE.">
  <li class="number">More of him anon. There is written in your brow, Provost, honesty and constancy; if I read it not truly, my ancient skill beguiles me; but in the boldness of my cunning, I will lay myself in hazard. Claudio, whom here you have warrant to execute, is no greater forfeit to the law than Angelo who hath sentenc’d him. To make you understand this in a manifested effect, I crave but four days’ respite; for the which you are to do me both a present and a dangerous courtesy.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PROV.">
  <li class="number">Pray, sir, in what?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE.">
  <li class="number">In the delaying death.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PROV.">
  <li class="number">Alack, how may I do it, having the hour limited, and an express command, under penalty, to deliver his head in the view of Angelo? I may make my case as Claudio’s, to cross this in the smallest.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE.">
  <li class="number">By the vow of mine order I warrant you, if my instructions may be your guide. Let this Barnardine be this morning executed, and his head borne to Angelo.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PROV.">
  <li class="number">Angelo hath seen them both, and will discover the favor.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE.">
  <li class="number">O, death’s a great disguiser, and you may add to it. Shave the head, and tie the beard, and say it was the desire of the penitent to be so bar’d before his death. You know the course is common. If any thing fall to you upon this, more than thanks and good fortune, by the saint whom I profess, I will plead against it with my life.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PROV.">
  <li class="number">Pardon me, good father, it is against my oath.</li>

  <li class="number">To him, and to his substitutes.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE.">
  <li class="number">You will think you have made no offense, if the Duke avouch the justice of your dealing?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PROV.">
  <li class="number">But what likelihood is in that?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE.">
  <li class="number">Not a resemblance, but a certainty; yet since I see you fearful, that neither my coat, integrity, nor persuasion can with ease attempt you, I will go further than I meant, to pluck all fears out of you. Look you, sir, here is the hand and seal of the Duke; you know the character, I doubt not, and the signet is not strange to you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PROV.">
  <li class="number">I know them both.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUKE.">
  <li class="number">The contents of this is the return of the Duke. You shall anon over-read it at your pleasure; where you shall find, within these two days he will be here. This is a thing that Angelo knows not, for he this very day receives letters of strange tenor, perchance of the Duke’s death, perchance entering into some monastery, but by chance nothing of what is writ. Look, th’ unfolding star calls up the shepherd. Put not yourself into amazement how these things should be; all difficulties are but easy when they are known. Call your executioner, and off with Barnardine’s head. I will give him a present shrift, and advise him for a better place. Yet you are amaz’d, but this shall absolutely resolve you. Come away, it is almost clear dawn.</li>
