  <li class="number">Good now, some excellent fortune! Let me be married to three kings in a forenoon, and widow them all. Let me have a child at fifty, to whom Herod of Jewry may do homage. Find me to marry me with Octavius Caesar, and companion me with my mistress.</li>

<ol data-speaker="CHAR.">
  <li class="number">Our worser thoughts heavens mend! Alexas—come, his fortune, his fortune! O, let him marry a woman that cannot go, sweet Isis, I beseech thee! And let her die too, and give him a worse! And let worse follow worse, till the worst of all follow him laughing to his grave, fiftyfold a cuckold! Good Isis, hear me this prayer, though thou deny me a matter of more weight; good Isis, I beseech thee!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IRAS.">
  <li class="number">Amen. Dear goddess, hear that prayer of the people! For, as it is a heart-breaking to see a handsome man loose-wiv’d, so it is a deadly sorrow to behold a foul knave uncuckolded; therefore, dear Isis, keep decorum, and fortune him accordingly!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CHAR.">
  <li class="number">Amen.</li>

<ol data-speaker="ANT.">
  <li class="number">I must be gone.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ENO.">
  <li class="number">Under a compelling occasion, let women die. It were pity to cast them away for nothing, though between them and a great cause, they should be esteem’d nothing. Cleopatra, catching but the least noise of this, dies instantly; I have seen her die twenty times upon far poorer moment. I do think there is mettle in death, which commits some loving act upon her, she hath such a celerity in dying.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANT.">
  <li class="number">She is cunning past man’s thought.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ENO.">
  <li class="number">Alack, sir, no, her passions are made of nothing but the finest part of pure love. We cannot call her winds and waters sighs and tears; they are greater storms and tempests than almanacs can report. This cannot be cunning in her; if it be, she makes a show’r of rain as well as Jove.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANT.">
  <li class="number">Would I had never seen her!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ENO.">
  <li class="number">O, sir, you had then left unseen a wonderful piece of work, which not to have been blest withal would have discredited your travel.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANT.">
  <li class="number">Fulvia is dead.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ENO.">
  <li class="number">Why, sir, give the gods a thankful sacrifice. When it pleaseth their deities to take the wife of a man from him, it shows to man the tailors of the earth; comforting therein, that when old robes are worn out, there are members to make new. If there were no more women but Fulvia, then had you indeed a cut, and the case to be lamented. This grief is crown’d with consolation: your old smock brings forth a new petticoat, and indeed the tears live in an onion that should water this sorrow.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANT.">
  <li class="number">The business she hath broached in the state</li>

  <li class="number">No more light answers. Let our officers</li>
  <li class="number">Have notice what we purpose. I shall break</li>

  <li class="number">The death of Fulvia, with more urgent touches,</li>
  <li class="number">Do strongly speak to us; but the letters too</li>
  <li class="number">Of many our contriving friends in Rome</li>
  <li class="number">Petition us at home. Sextus Pompeius</li>
  <li class="number">Hath given the dare to Caesar, and commands</li>
  <li class="number">The empire of the sea. Our slippery people,</li>
  <li class="number">Whose love is never link’d to the deserver</li>

  <li class="number">Higher than both in blood and life, stands up</li>
  <li class="number">For the main soldier; whose quality, going on,</li>
  <li class="number">The sides o’ th’ world may danger. Much is breeding,</li>
  <li class="number">Which, like the courser’s hair, hath yet but life,</li>
  <li class="number">And not a serpent’s poison. Say our pleasure,</li>

  <li class="number">Hear me, Queen:</li>
  <li class="number">The strong necessity of time commands</li>

<h4>Rome. Octavius Caesar’s house.</h4>

<div class="stage-direction">
	Enter Octavius Caesar reading a letter, Lepidus, and their Train.
	
		CAES.
		LEP.
	
</div>

<ol data-speaker="CAES.">
  <li class="number">You may see, Lepidus, and henceforth know,</li>
  <li class="number">It is not Caesar’s natural vice to hate</li>
  <li class="number">Our great competitor. From Alexandria</li>
  <li class="number">This is the news: he fishes, drinks, and wastes</li>
  <li class="number">The lamps of night in revel; is not more manlike</li>
  <li class="number">Than Cleopatra; nor the queen of Ptolomy</li>
  <li class="number">More womanly than he; hardly gave audience, or</li>
  <li class="number">Vouchsaf’d to think he had partners. You shall find there</li>
  <li class="number">A man who is th’ abstract of all faults</li>
  <li class="number">That all men follow.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEP.">
  <li class="number">I must not think there are</li>
  <li class="number">Evils enow to darken all his goodness:</li>
  <li class="number">His faults, in him, seem as the spots of heaven,</li>
  <li class="number">More fiery by night’s blackness; hereditary,</li>
  <li class="number">Rather than purchas’d; what he cannot change,</li>
  <li class="number">Than what he chooses.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAES.">
  <li class="number">You are too indulgent. Let’s grant it is not</li>
  <li class="number">Amiss to tumble on the bed of Ptolomy,</li>
  <li class="number">To give a kingdom for a mirth, to sit</li>
  <li class="number">And keep the turn of tippling with a slave,</li>
  <li class="number">To reel the streets at noon, and stand the buffet</li>
  <li class="number">With knaves that smells of sweat: say this becomes him</li>
  <li class="number">(As his composure must be rare indeed</li>
  <li class="number">Whom these things cannot blemish), yet must Antony</li>
  <li class="number">No way excuse his foils, when we do bear</li>
  <li class="number">So great weight in his lightness. If he fill’d</li>
  <li class="number">His vacancy with his voluptuousness,</li>
  <li class="number">Full surfeits and the dryness of his bones</li>
  <li class="number">Call on him for’t. But to confound such time</li>
  <li class="number">That drums him from his sport and speaks as loud</li>
  <li class="number">As his own state and ours, ’tis to be chid—</li>
  <li class="number">As we rate boys who, being mature in knowledge,</li>
  <li class="number">Pawn their experience to their present pleasure,</li>
  <li class="number">And so rebel to judgment.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">

<ol data-speaker="LEP.">
  <li class="number">Here’s more news.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. CAES. MESS.">
  <li class="number">Thy biddings have been done, and every hour,</li>
  <li class="number">Most noble Caesar, shalt thou have report</li>
  <li class="number">How ’tis abroad. Pompey is strong at sea,</li>
  <li class="number">And it appears he is belov’d of those</li>
  <li class="number">That only have fear’d Caesar; to the ports</li>
  <li class="number">The discontents repair, and men’s reports</li>
  <li class="number">Give him much wrong’d.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAES.">
  <li class="number">I should have known no less:</li>
  <li class="number">It hath been taught us from the primal state</li>
  <li class="number">That he which is was wish’d, until he were;</li>
  <li class="number">And the ebb’d man, ne’er lov’d till ne’er worth love,</li>
  <li class="number">Comes dear’d by being lack’d. This common body,</li>
  <li class="number">Like to a vagabond flag upon the stream,</li>
  <li class="number">Goes to and back, lackeying the varying tide,</li>
  <li class="number">To rot itself with motion.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">
	Enter Caesar’s Second Messenger.
	
		2. CAES. MESS.
	
</div>

<ol data-speaker="2. CAES. MESS.">
  <li class="number">Caesar, I bring thee word</li>
  <li class="number">Menecrates and Menas, famous pirates,</li>
  <li class="number">Makes the sea serve them, which they ear and wound</li>
  <li class="number">With keels of every kind. Many hot inroads</li>
  <li class="number">They make in Italy; the borders maritime</li>
  <li class="number">Lack blood to think on’t, and flush youth revolt.</li>
  <li class="number">No vessel can peep forth, but ’tis as soon</li>
  <li class="number">Taken as seen; for Pompey’s name strikes more</li>
  <li class="number">Than could his war resisted.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAES.">
  <li class="number">Antony,</li>
  <li class="number">Leave thy lascivious wassails. When thou once</li>
  <li class="number">Was beaten from Modena, where thou slew’st</li>
  <li class="number">Hirtius and Pansa, consuls, at thy heel</li>
  <li class="number">Did famine follow, whom thou fought’st against</li>
  <li class="number">(Though daintily brought up) with patience more</li>
  <li class="number">Than savages could suffer. Thou didst drink</li>
  <li class="number">The stale of horses and the gilded puddle</li>
  <li class="number">Which beasts would cough at; thy palate then did deign</li>
  <li class="number">The roughest berry on the rudest hedge;</li>
  <li class="number">Yea, like the stag, when snow the pasture sheets,</li>
  <li class="number">The barks of trees thou brows’d. On the Alps</li>
  <li class="number">It is reported thou didst eat strange flesh,</li>
  <li class="number">Which some did die to look on; and all this</li>
  <li class="number">(It wounds thine honor that I speak it now)</li>
  <li class="number">Was borne so like a soldier, that thy cheek</li>
  <li class="number">So much as lank’d not.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEP.">
  <li class="number">’Tis pity of him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAES.">
  <li class="number">Let his shames quickly</li>
  <li class="number">Drive him to Rome. ’Tis time we twain</li>
  <li class="number">Did show ourselves i’ th’ field, and to that end</li>
  <li class="number">Assemble we immediate council. Pompey</li>
  <li class="number">Thrives in our idleness.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEP.">
  <li class="number">Tomorrow, Caesar,</li>
  <li class="number">I shall be furnish’d to inform you rightly</li>
  <li class="number">Both what by sea and land I can be able</li>
  <li class="number">To front this present time.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAES.">
  <li class="number">Till which encounter,</li>

  <li class="number">Do bravely, horse, for wot’st thou whom thou mov’st?</li>
  <li class="number">The demi-Atlas of this earth, the arm</li>

<ol data-speaker="CAES.">
  <li class="number">You may be pleas’d to catch at mine intent</li>
  <li class="number">By what did here befall me. Your wife and brother</li>

<ol data-speaker="ANT.">
  <li class="number">You do mistake your business, my brother never</li>

  <li class="number">That drew their swords with you. Did he not rather</li>
  <li class="number">Discredit my authority with yours,</li>
  <li class="number">And make the wars alike against my stomach,</li>
  <li class="number">Having alike your cause? Of this my letters</li>

  <li class="number">Not so, not so:</li>
  <li class="number">I know you could not lack, I am certain on’t,</li>
  <li class="number">Very necessity of this thought, that I,</li>
  <li class="number">Your partner in the cause ’gainst which he fought,</li>
  <li class="number">Could not with graceful eyes attend those wars</li>
  <li class="number">Which fronted mine own peace. As for my wife,</li>
  <li class="number">I would you had her spirit in such another;</li>
  <li class="number">The third o’ th’ world is yours, which with a snaffle</li>
  <li class="number">You may pace easy, but not such a wife.</li>

<ol data-speaker="ANT.">
  <li class="number">So much uncurbable, her garboils, Caesar,</li>
  <li class="number">Made out of her impatience—which not wanted</li>

  <li class="number">Did you too much disquiet. For that you must</li>
  <li class="number">But say I could not help it.</li>

<ol data-speaker="CAES.">
  <li class="number">I wrote to you,</li>
  <li class="number">When rioting in Alexandria you</li>

  <li class="number">Three kings I had newly feasted, and did want</li>

  <li class="number">No, Lepidus, let him speak.</li>
  <li class="number">The honor is sacred which he talks on now,</li>
  <li class="number">Supposing that I lack’d it. But on, Caesar,</li>
  <li class="number">The article of my oath.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAES.">
  <li class="number">To lend me arms and aid when I requir’d them,</li>
  <li class="number">The which you both denied.</li>

<ol data-speaker="ANT.">
  <li class="number">Neglected, rather;</li>
  <li class="number">And then when poisoned hours had bound me up</li>
  <li class="number">From mine own knowledge. As nearly as I may,</li>
  <li class="number">I’ll play the penitent to you; but mine honesty</li>
  <li class="number">Shall not make poor my greatness, nor my power</li>
  <li class="number">Work without it. Truth is, that Fulvia,</li>
  <li class="number">To have me out of Egypt, made wars here;</li>
  <li class="number">For which myself, the ignorant motive, do</li>
  <li class="number">So far ask pardon as befits mine honor</li>
  <li class="number">To stoop in such a case.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEP.">
  <li class="number">’Tis noble spoken.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MAEC.">
  <li class="number">If it might please you, to enforce no further</li>
  <li class="number">The griefs between ye: to forget them quite</li>
  <li class="number">Were to remember that the present need</li>
  <li class="number">Speaks to atone you.</li>

  <li class="number">Or, if you borrow one another’s love for the instant, you may, when you hear no more words of Pompey, return it again. You shall have time to wrangle in when you have nothing else to do.</li>

  <li class="number">Thou art a soldier only, speak no more.</li>

<ol data-speaker="ENO.">
  <li class="number">That truth should be silent I had almost forgot.</li>

  <li class="number">All little jealousies, which now seem great,</li>
  <li class="number">And all great fears, which now import their dangers,</li>

<ol data-speaker="MENAS.">
  <li class="number">I think the policy of that purpose made more in the marriage than the love of the parties.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ENO.">
  <li class="number">I think so too. But you shall find the band that seems to tie their friendship together will be the very strangler of their amity. Octavia is of a holy, cold, and still conversation.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MENAS.">
  <li class="number">Who would not have his wife so?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ENO.">
  <li class="number">Not he that himself is not so; which is Mark Antony. He will to his Egyptian dish again. Then shall the sighs of Octavia blow the fire up in Caesar, and (as I said before) that which is the strength of their amity shall prove the immediate author of their variance. Antony will use his affection where it is; he married but his occasion here.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MENAS.">
