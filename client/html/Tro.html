<h4>Troy. Before Priam’s palace.</h4>

<div class="stage-direction">
	Enter Pandarus and Troilus.

<ol data-speaker="TRO.">
  <li class="number">Call here my varlet, I’ll unarm again.</li>
  <li class="number">Why should I war without the walls of Troy,</li>
  <li class="number">That find such cruel battle here within?</li>
  <li class="number">Each Troyan that is master of his heart,</li>
  <li class="number">Let him to field, Troilus, alas, hath none.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li class="number">Will this gear ne’er be mended?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TRO.">
  <li class="number">The Greeks are strong, and skillful to their strength,</li>
  <li class="number">Fierce to their skill, and to their fierceness valiant,</li>
  <li class="number">But I am weaker than a woman’s tear,</li>
  <li class="number">Tamer than sleep, fonder than ignorance,</li>
  <li class="number">Less valiant than the virgin in the night,</li>
  <li class="number">And skilless as unpractic’d infancy.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li class="number">Well, I have told you enough of this. For my part, I’ll not meddle nor make no farther. 
He that will have a cake out of the wheat must tarry the grinding.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TRO.">
  <li class="number">Have I not tarried?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li class="number">Ay, the grinding; but you must tarry the bolting.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TRO.">
  <li class="number">Have I not tarried?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li class="number">Ay, the bolting; but you must tarry the leavening.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TRO.">
  <li class="number">Still have I tarried.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li class="number">Ay, to the leavening, but here’s yet in the word “hereafter” the kneading, the making of the cake, the heating the oven, and the baking; nay, you must stay the cooling too, or ye may chance burn your lips.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TRO.">
  <li class="number">Patience herself, what goddess e’er she be,</li>
  <li class="number">Doth lesser blench at suff’rance than I do.</li>
  <li class="number">At Priam’s royal table do I sit,</li>
  <li class="number">And when fair Cressid comes into my thoughts—</li>
  <li class="number">So, traitor, then she comes when she is thence.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li class="number">Well, she look’d yesternight fairer than ever</li>
  <li class="number">I saw her look, or any woman else.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TRO.">
  <li class="number">I was about to tell thee—when my heart,</li>
  <li class="number">As wedged with a sigh, would rive in twain,</li>
  <li class="number">Lest Hector or my father should perceive me,</li>
  <li class="number">I have (as when the sun doth light a-scorn)</li>
  <li class="number">Buried this sigh in wrinkle of a smile,</li>
  <li class="number">But sorrow that is couch’d in seeming gladness</li>
  <li class="number">Is like that mirth fate turns to sudden sadness.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li class="number">And her hair were not somewhat darker than Helen’s—well, go to!—there were no more comparison between the women! 
But for my part, she is my kinswoman; I would not, as they term it, praise her, but I would somebody had heard her talk yesterday as I did. 
I will not dispraise your sister Cassandra’s wit, but—</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TRO.">
  <li class="number">O Pandarus! I tell thee, Pandarus—</li>
  <li class="number">When I do tell thee there my hopes lie drown’d,</li>
  <li class="number">Reply not in how many fathoms deep</li>
  <li class="number">They lie indrench’d. I tell thee I am mad</li>
  <li class="number">In Cressid’s love; thou answer’st she is fair,</li>
  <li class="number">Pourest in the open ulcer of my heart</li>
  <li class="number">Her eyes, her hair, her cheek, her gait, her voice,</li>
  <li class="number">Handiest in thy discourse, O, that her hand,</li>
  <li class="number">In whose comparison all whites are ink</li>
  <li class="number">Writing their own reproach; to whose soft seizure</li>
  <li class="number">The cygnet’s down is harsh, and spirit of sense</li>
  <li class="number">Hard as the palm of ploughman. This thou tell’st me,</li>
  <li class="number">As true thou tell’st me, when I say I love her,</li>
  <li class="number">But saying thus, in stead of oil and balm,</li>
  <li class="number">Thou lay’st in every gash that love hath given me</li>
  <li class="number">The knife that made it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li class="number">I speak no more than truth.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TRO.">
  <li class="number">Thou dost not speak so much.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li class="number">Faith, I’ll not meddle in it, let her be as she is; if she be fair, ’tis the better for her; and she be not, she has the mends in her own hands.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TRO.">
  <li class="number">Good Pandarus! How now, Pandarus?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li class="number">I have had my labor for my travail; ill thought on of her, and ill thought on of you; gone between and between, but small thanks for my labor.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TRO.">
  <li class="number">What, art thou angry, Pandarus? What, with me?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li class="number">Because she’s kin to me, therefore she’s not so fair as Helen. And she were not kin to me, she would be as fair a’ 
Friday as Helen is on Sunday. But what care I? I care not and she were a blackamoor, ’tis all one to me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TRO.">
  <li class="number">Say I she is not fair?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li class="number">I do not care whether you do or no. She’s a fool to stay behind her father, let her to the Greeks; and so I’ll tell her the next time I see her. 
For my part, I’ll meddle nor make no more i’ th’ matter.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TRO.">
  <li class="number">Pandarus—</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li class="number">Not I.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TRO.">
  <li class="number">Sweet Pandarus—</li>
</ol>

  <li class="number">Peace, you ungracious clamors! Peace, rude sounds!</li>
  <li class="number">Fools on both sides, Helen must needs be fair,</li>
  <li class="number">When with your blood you daily paint her thus.</li>
  <li class="number">I cannot fight upon this argument;</li>
  <li class="number">It is too starv’d a subject for my sword.</li>
  <li class="number">But Pandarus—O gods! How do you plague me!</li>
  <li class="number">I cannot come to Cressid but by Pandar,</li>
  <li class="number">And he’s as tetchy to be woo’d to woo,</li>
  <li class="number">As she is stubborn-chaste against all suit.</li>
  <li class="number">Tell me, Apollo, for thy Daphne’s love,</li>
  <li class="number">What Cressid is, what Pandar, and what we:</li>
  <li class="number">Her bed is India, there she lies, a pearl;</li>
  <li class="number">Between our Ilium and where she resides,</li>

<h4>Troy. A street.</h4>

<div class="stage-direction">
	Enter Cressida and her man Alexander.
	
		CRES.
		ALEX.
	
</div>

<ol data-speaker="CRES.">
  <li class="number">Who were those went by?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ALEX.">
  <li class="number">Queen Hecuba and Helen.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CRES.">
  <li class="number">And whither go they?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ALEX.">
  <li class="number">Up to the eastern tower,</li>
  <li class="number">Whose height commands as subject all the vale,</li>
  <li class="number">To see the battle. Hector, whose patience</li>
  <li class="number">Is as a virtue fix’d, today was mov’d:</li>
  <li class="number">He chid Andromache and struck his armorer,</li>
  <li class="number">And like as there were husbandry in war,</li>
  <li class="number">Before the sun rose he was harness’d light,</li>
  <li class="number">And to the field goes he; where every flower</li>
  <li class="number">Did as a prophet weep what it foresaw</li>
  <li class="number">In Hector’s wrath.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CRES.">
  <li class="number">What was his cause of anger?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ALEX.">
  <li class="number">The noise goes, this: there is among the Greeks</li>
  <li class="number">A lord of Troyan blood, nephew to Hector,</li>
  <li class="number">They call him Ajax.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CRES.">
  <li class="number">Good; and what of him?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ALEX.">
  <li class="number">They say he is a very man <foreign xml:lang="la">per se</foreign> and stands alone.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CRES.">
  <li class="number">So do all men, unless th’ are drunk, sick, or have no legs.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ALEX.">
  <li class="number">This man, lady, hath robb’d many beasts of their particular additions: he is as valiant as the lion, churlish as the bear, slow as the elephant; 
a man into whom nature hath so crowded humors that his valor is crush’d into folly, his folly sauc’d with discretion. There is no man hath a virtue that he hath not a glimpse of, nor any man an attaint but he carries some stain of it. He is melancholy without cause, and merry against the hair; he hath the joints of every thing, but every thing so out of joint that he is a gouty Briareus, many hands and no use, or purblind Argus, all eyes and no sight.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CRES.">
  <li class="number">But how should this man, that makes me smile, make Hector angry?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ALEX.">
  <li class="number">They say he yesterday cop’d Hector in the battle and struck him down, the disdain and shame whereof hath ever since kept Hector fasting and waking.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">
	Enter Pandarus.
	
		PAN.
	
</div>

<ol data-speaker="CRES.">
  <li class="number">Who comes here?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ALEX.">
  <li class="number">Madam, your uncle Pandarus.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CRES.">
  <li class="number">Hector’s a gallant man.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ALEX.">
  <li class="number">As may be in the world, lady.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li class="number">What’s that? What’s that?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CRES.">
  <li class="number">Good morrow, uncle Pandarus.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li class="number">Good morrow, cousin Cressid. What do you talk of? Good morrow, Alexander. How do you, cousin? When were you at Ilium?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CRES.">
  <li class="number">This morning, uncle.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li class="number">What were you talking of when I came? Was Hector arm’d and gone ere ye came to Ilium? Helen was not up, was she?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CRES.">
  <li class="number">Hector was gone, but Helen was not up.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li class="number">E’en so; Hector was stirring early.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CRES.">
  <li class="number">That were we talking of, and of his anger.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li class="number">Was he angry?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CRES.">
  <li class="number">So he says here.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li class="number">True, he was so; I know the cause too. He’ll lay about him today, I can tell them that, and there’s Troilus will not come far behind him. Let them take heed of Troilus; I can tell them that too.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CRES.">
  <li class="number">What, is he angry too?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li class="number">Who, Troilus? Troilus is the better man of the two.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CRES.">
  <li class="number">O Jupiter, there’s no comparison.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li class="number">What, not between Troilus and Hector? Do you know a man if you see him?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CRES.">
  <li class="number">Ay, if I ever saw him before and knew him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li class="number">Well, I say Troilus is Troilus.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CRES.">
  <li class="number">Then you say as I say, for I am sure he is not Hector.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li class="number">No, nor Hector is not Troilus in some degrees.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CRES.">
  <li class="number">’Tis just to each of them; he is himself.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li class="number">Himself? Alas, poor Troilus, I would he were!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CRES.">
  <li class="number">So he is.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li class="number">Condition I had gone barefoot to India.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CRES.">
  <li class="number">He is not Hector.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li class="number">Himself? No! He’s not himself. Would ’a were himself! Well, the gods are above, time must friend or end. Well, Troilus, well, I would my heart were in her body. No, Hector is not a better man than Troilus.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CRES.">
  <li class="number">Excuse me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li class="number">He is elder.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CRES.">
  <li class="number">Pardon me, pardon me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li class="number">Th’ other’s not come to’t. You shall tell me another tale when th’ other’s come to’t. 
Hector shall not have his wit this year.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CRES.">
  <li class="number">He shall not need it if he have his own.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li class="number">Nor his qualities.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CRES.">
  <li class="number">No matter.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li class="number">Nor his beauty.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CRES.">
  <li class="number">’Twould not become him, his own’s better.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li class="number">You have no judgment, niece. Helen herself swore th’ other day that Troilus, for a brown favor (for so ’tis, I must confess)—not brown neither—</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CRES.">
  <li class="number">No, but brown.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li class="number">Faith, to say truth, brown and not brown.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CRES.">
  <li class="number">To say the truth, true and not true.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li class="number">She prais’d his complexion above Paris.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CRES.">
  <li class="number">Why, Paris hath color enough.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li class="number">So he has.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CRES.">
  <li class="number">Then Troilus should have too much: if she prais’d him above, his complexion is higher than his. He having color enough, and the other higher, is too flaming a praise for a good complexion. I had as lief Helen’s golden tongue had commended Troilus for a copper nose.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li class="number">I swear to you, I think Helen loves him better than Paris.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CRES.">
  <li class="number">Then she’s a merry Greek indeed.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li class="number">Nay, I am sure she does. She came to him th’ other day into the compass’d window—and you know he has not past three or four hairs on his chin—</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CRES.">
  <li class="number">Indeed a tapster’s arithmetic may soon bring his particulars therein to a total.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li class="number">Why, he is very young, and yet will he, within three pound, lift as much as his brother Hector.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CRES.">
  <li class="number">Is he so young a man and so old a lifter?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li class="number">But to prove to you that Helen loves him: she came and puts me her white hand to his cloven chin—</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CRES.">
  <li class="number">Juno have mercy! How came it cloven?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li class="number">Why, you know ’tis dimpled. I think his smiling becomes him better than any man in all Phrygia.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CRES.">
  <li class="number">O, he smiles valiantly.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li class="number">Does he not?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CRES.">
  <li class="number">O yes, and ’twere a cloud in autumn.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li class="number">Why, go to then. But to prove to you that Helen loves Troilus—</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CRES.">
  <li class="number">Troilus will stand to the proof, if you’ll prove it so.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li class="number">Troilus! Why, he esteems her no more than I esteem an addle egg.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CRES.">
  <li class="number">If you love an addle egg as well as you love an idle head, you would eat chickens i’ th’ shell.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li class="number">I cannot choose but laugh to think how she tickled his chin. Indeed she has a marvel’s white hand, I must needs confess.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CRES.">
  <li class="number">Without the rack.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li class="number">And she takes upon her to spy a white hair on his chin.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CRES.">
  <li class="number">Alas, poor chin! Many a wart is richer.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li class="number">But there was such laughing! Queen Hecuba laugh’d that her eyes ran o’er.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CRES.">
  <li class="number">With millstones.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li class="number">And Cassandra laugh’d.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CRES.">
  <li class="number">But there was a more temperate fire under the pot of her eyes. Did her eyes run o’er too?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li class="number">And Hector laugh’d.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CRES.">
  <li class="number">At what was all this laughing?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li class="number">Marry, at the white hair that Helen spied on Troilus’ chin.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CRES.">
  <li class="number">And’t had been a green hair, I should have laugh’d too.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li class="number">They laugh’d not so much at the hair as at his pretty answer.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CRES.">
  <li class="number">What was his answer?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li class="number">Quoth she, “Here’s but two and fifty hairs on your chin—and one of them is white.”</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CRES.">
  <li class="number">This is her question.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li class="number">That’s true, make no question of that. “Two and fifty hairs,” quoth he, “and one white. 
That white hair is my father, and all the rest are his sons.” “Jupiter,” quoth she, “which of these hairs is 
Paris my husband?” “The fork’d one,” quoth he, “pluck’t out, and give it him.” But there was such laughing! And Helen so blush’d, and Paris so chaf’d, and all the rest so laugh’d, that it pass’d.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CRES.">
  <li class="number">So let it now, for it has been a great while going by.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li class="number">Well, cousin, I told you a thing yesterday, think on’t.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CRES.">
  <li class="number">So I do.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li class="number">I’ll be sworn ’tis true; he will weep you an’ ’twere a man born in April.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">

<ol data-speaker="CRES.">
  <li class="number">At your pleasure.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAN.">
  <li class="number">Here, here, here’s an excellent place, here we may see most bravely. I’ll tell you them all by their names as they pass by, but mark Troilus above the rest.</li>

  <li class="number">What honey is expected? Degree being vizarded,</li>
  <li class="number">Th’ unworthiest shows as fairly in the mask.</li>
  <li class="number">The heavens themselves, the planets, and this centre</li>
  <li class="number">Observe degree, priority, and place,</li>
  <li class="number">Insisture, course, proportion, season, form,</li>

  <li class="number">The primogenity and due of birth,</li>

  <li class="number">But by degree stand in authentic place?</li>
  <li class="number">Take but degree away, untune that string,</li>
  <li class="number">And hark what discord follows. Each thing meets</li>
  <li class="number">In mere oppugnancy: the bounded waters</li>
  <li class="number">Should lift their bosoms higher than the shores,</li>
  <li class="number">And make a sop of all this solid globe;</li>
  <li class="number">Strength should be lord of imbecility,</li>
  <li class="number">And the rude son should strike his father dead;</li>
  <li class="number">Force should be right, or rather, right and wrong</li>
  <li class="number">(Between whose endless jar justice resides)</li>
  <li class="number">Should lose their names, and so should justice too!</li>
  <li class="number">Then every thing include itself in power,</li>

  <li class="number">This chaos, when degree is suffocate,</li>

  <li class="number">And this neglection of degree it is</li>
  <li class="number">That by a pace goes backward with a purpose</li>
  <li class="number">It hath to climb. The general’s disdain’d</li>

  <li class="number">That next by him beneath; so every step,</li>

  <li class="number">The sinew and the forehand of our host,</li>
  <li class="number">Having his ear full of his airy fame,</li>
  <li class="number">Grows dainty of his worth, and in his tent</li>
  <li class="number">Lies mocking our designs. With him Patroclus</li>
  <li class="number">Upon a lazy bed the livelong day</li>
  <li class="number">Breaks scurril jests,</li>
  <li class="number">And with ridiculous and awkward action,</li>
  <li class="number">Which, slanderer, he imitation calls,</li>
  <li class="number">He pageants us. Sometime, great Agamemnon,</li>
  <li class="number">Thy topless deputation he puts on,</li>
  <li class="number">And like a strutting player, whose conceit</li>
  <li class="number">Lies in his hamstring, and doth think it rich</li>
  <li class="number">To hear the wooden dialogue and sound</li>
  <li class="number">’Twixt his stretch’d footing and the scaffoldage,</li>
  <li class="number">Such to-be-pitied and o’er-wrested seeming</li>
  <li class="number">He acts thy greatness in; and when he speaks,</li>
  <li class="number">’Tis like a chime a-mending, with terms unsquar’d,</li>
  <li class="number">Which from the tongue of roaring Typhon dropp’d</li>
  <li class="number">Would seem hyperboles. At this fusty stuff</li>
  <li class="number">The large Achilles, on his press’d bed lolling,</li>
  <li class="number">From his deep chest laughs out a loud applause,</li>
  <li class="number">Cries, “Excellent! ’Tis Agamemnon right!</li>
  <li class="number">Now play me Nestor, hem, and stroke thy beard,</li>
  <li class="number">As he being dress’d to some oration.”</li>
  <li class="number">That’s done, as near as the extremest ends</li>
  <li class="number">Of parallels, as like as Vulcan and his wife;</li>
  <li class="number">Yet god Achilles still cries, “Excellent!</li>
  <li class="number">’Tis Nestor right. Now play him me, Patroclus,</li>
  <li class="number">Arming to answer in a night alarm.”</li>
  <li class="number">And then forsooth the faint defects of age</li>
  <li class="number">Must be the scene of mirth; to cough and spit,</li>
  <li class="number">And with a palsy fumbling on his gorget,</li>
  <li class="number">Shake in and out the rivet; and at this sport</li>
  <li class="number">Sir Valor dies; cries, “O, enough, Patroclus,</li>
  <li class="number">Or give me ribs of steel! I shall split all</li>
  <li class="number">In pleasure of my spleen.” And in this fashion,</li>
  <li class="number">All our abilities, gifts, natures, shapes,</li>
  <li class="number">Severals and generals of grace exact,</li>
  <li class="number">Achievements, plots, orders, preventions,</li>
  <li class="number">Excitements to the field, or speech for truce,</li>

  <li class="number">In such a rein, in full as proud a place</li>

  <li class="number">Makes factious feasts, rails on our state of war,</li>

  <li class="number">A slave whose gall coins slanders like a mint,</li>
  <li class="number">To match us in comparisons with dirt,</li>

  <li class="number">We have, great Agamemnon, here in Troy</li>
  <li class="number">A prince call’d Hector—Priam is his father—</li>
  <li class="number">Who in this dull and long-continued truce</li>
  <li class="number">Is resty grown. He bade me take a trumpet,</li>
  <li class="number">And to this purpose speak: kings, princes, lords!</li>
  <li class="number">If there be one among the fair’st of Greece</li>
  <li class="number">That holds his honor higher than his ease,</li>
  <li class="number">And seeks his praise more than he fears his peril,</li>
  <li class="number">That knows his valor, and knows not his fear,</li>
  <li class="number">That loves his mistress more than in confession</li>
  <li class="number">With truant vows to her own lips he loves,</li>
  <li class="number">And dare avow her beauty and her worth</li>
  <li class="number">In other arms than hers—to him this challenge!</li>
  <li class="number">Hector, in view of Troyans and of Greeks,</li>
  <li class="number">Shall make it good, or do his best to do it:</li>
  <li class="number">He hath a lady, wiser, fairer, truer,</li>
  <li class="number">Than ever Greek did couple in his arms,</li>
  <li class="number">And will tomorrow with his trumpet call,</li>
  <li class="number">Midway between your tents and walls of Troy,</li>
  <li class="number">To rouse a Grecian that is true in love.</li>
  <li class="number">If any come, Hector shall honor him;</li>
  <li class="number">If none, he’ll say in Troy when he retires,</li>
  <li class="number">The Grecian dames are sunburnt, and not worth</li>
  <li class="number">The splinter of a lance. Even so much.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="AGAM.">
  <li class="number">This shall be told our lovers, Lord Aeneas.</li>
  <li class="number">If none of them have soul in such a kind,</li>
  <li class="number">We left them all at home. But we are soldiers,</li>
  <li class="number">And may that soldier a mere recreant prove,</li>
  <li class="number">That means not, hath not, or is not in love!</li>
  <li class="number">If then one is, or hath, or means to be,</li>
  <li class="number">That one meets Hector; if none else, I am he.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NEST.">
  <li class="number">Tell him of Nestor, one that was a man</li>
  <li class="number">When Hector’s grandsire suck’d. He is old now,</li>

  <li class="number">A noble man that hath no spark of fire</li>
  <li class="number">To answer for his love, tell him from me</li>
  <li class="number">I’ll hide my silver beard in a gold beaver,</li>
  <li class="number">And in my vambrace put my withered brawns,</li>
  <li class="number">And meeting him will tell him that my lady</li>
  <li class="number">Was fairer than his grandam, and as chaste</li>
  <li class="number">As may be in the world. His youth in flood,</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ULYSS.">
  <li class="number">I have a young conception in my brain,</li>
  <li class="number">Be you my time to bring it to some shape.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NEST.">
  <li class="number">What is’t?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ULYSS.">
  <li class="number">This ’tis:</li>
  <li class="number">Blunt wedges rive hard knots; the seeded pride</li>
  <li class="number">That hath to this maturity blown up</li>
  <li class="number">In rank Achilles must or now be cropp’d,</li>
  <li class="number">Or shedding, breed a nursery of like evil,</li>
  <li class="number">To overbulk us all.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NEST.">
  <li class="number">Well, and how?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ULYSS.">
  <li class="number">This challenge that the gallant Hector sends,</li>
  <li class="number">However it is spread in general name,</li>
  <li class="number">Relates in purpose only to Achilles.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NEST.">
  <li class="number">True, the purpose is perspicuous as substance,</li>
  <li class="number">Whose grossness little characters sum up;</li>
  <li class="number">And in the publication make no strain</li>
  <li class="number">But that Achilles, were his brain as barren</li>
  <li class="number">As banks of Libya (though, Apollo knows,</li>
  <li class="number">’Tis dry enough), will with great speed of judgment,</li>
  <li class="number">Ay, with celerity, find Hector’s purpose</li>
  <li class="number">Pointing on him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ULYSS.">
  <li class="number">And wake him to the answer, think you?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NEST.">
  <li class="number">Why, ’tis most meet; who may you else oppose</li>
  <li class="number">That can from Hector bring those honors off,</li>
  <li class="number">If not Achilles? Though’t be a sportful combat,</li>
  <li class="number">Yet in the trial much opinion dwells;</li>
  <li class="number">For here the Troyans taste our dear’st repute</li>
  <li class="number">With their fin’st palate; and trust to me, Ulysses,</li>
  <li class="number">Our imputation shall be oddly pois’d</li>
  <li class="number">In this vild action, for the success,</li>
  <li class="number">Although particular, shall give a scantling</li>
  <li class="number">Of good or bad unto the general,</li>
  <li class="number">And in such indexes (although small pricks</li>
  <li class="number">To their subsequent volumes) there is seen</li>
  <li class="number">The baby figure of the giant mass</li>
  <li class="number">Of things to come at large. It is suppos’d</li>
  <li class="number">He that meets Hector issues from our choice,</li>
  <li class="number">And choice (being mutual act of all our souls)</li>
  <li class="number">Makes merit her election, and doth boil</li>
  <li class="number">(As ’twere from forth us all) a man distill’d</li>
  <li class="number">Out of our virtues, who miscarrying,</li>
  <li class="number">What heart receives from hence a conquering part</li>
  <li class="number">To steel a strong opinion to themselves?</li>
  <li class="number">Which entertain’d, limbs are his instruments,</li>
  <li class="number">In no less working than are swords and bows</li>
  <li class="number">Directive by the limbs.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ULYSS.">
  <li class="number">Give pardon to my speech:</li>
  <li class="number">Therefore ’tis meet Achilles meet not Hector.</li>
  <li class="number">Let us like merchants first show foul wares,</li>
  <li class="number">And think perchance they’ll sell; if not,</li>
  <li class="number">The lustre of the better shall exceed</li>
  <li class="number">By showing the worse first. Do not consent</li>
  <li class="number">That ever Hector and Achilles meet,</li>
  <li class="number">For both our honor and our shame in this</li>
  <li class="number">Are dogg’d with two strange followers.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NEST.">
  <li class="number">I see them not with my old eyes, what are they?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ULYSS.">
  <li class="number">What glory our Achilles shares from Hector,</li>
  <li class="number">Were he not proud, we all should share with him.</li>
  <li class="number">But he already is too insolent;</li>
  <li class="number">And it were better parch in Afric sun</li>
  <li class="number">Than in the pride and salt scorn of his eyes,</li>
  <li class="number">Should he scape Hector fair. If he were foil’d,</li>
  <li class="number">Why then we do our main opinion crush</li>
  <li class="number">In taint of our best man. No, make a lott’ry,</li>
  <li class="number">And by device let blockish Ajax draw</li>
  <li class="number">The sort to fight with Hector; among ourselves</li>
  <li class="number">Give him allowance for the better man,</li>
  <li class="number">For that will physic the great Myrmidon,</li>
  <li class="number">Who broils in loud applause, and make him fall</li>
  <li class="number">His crest that prouder than blue Iris bends.</li>
  <li class="number">If the dull brainless Ajax come safe off,</li>
  <li class="number">We’ll dress him up in voices; if he fail,</li>
  <li class="number">Yet go we under our opinion still</li>
  <li class="number">That we have better men. But hit or miss,</li>
  <li class="number">Our project’s life this shape of sense assumes:</li>
  <li class="number">Ajax employ’d plucks down Achilles’ plumes.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NEST.">
  <li class="number">Now, Ulysses, I begin to relish thy advice,</li>
  <li class="number">And I will give a taste thereof forthwith</li>
  <li class="number">To Agamemnon. Go we to him straight.</li>
  <li class="number">Two curs shall tame each other; pride alone</li>
  <li class="number">Must tarre the mastiffs on, as ’twere a bone.</li>

<ol data-speaker="PRI.">
  <li class="number">After so many hours, lives, speeches spent,</li>
  <li class="number">Thus once again says Nestor from the Greeks;</li>
  <li class="number">“Deliver Helen, and all damage else—</li>
  <li class="number">As honor, loss of time, travail, expense,</li>
  <li class="number">Wounds, friends, and what else dear that is consum’d</li>
  <li class="number">In hot digestion of this cormorant war—</li>
  <li class="number">Shall be struck off.” Hector, what say you to’t?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HECT.">
  <li class="number">Though no man lesser fears the Greeks than I</li>
  <li class="number">As far as toucheth my particular,</li>
  <li class="number">Yet, dread Priam,</li>
  <li class="number">There is no lady of more softer bowels,</li>
  <li class="number">More spungy to suck in the sense of fear,</li>
  <li class="number">More ready to cry out, “Who knows what follows?”</li>
  <li class="number">Than Hector is. The wound of peace is surety,</li>
  <li class="number">Surety secure, but modest doubt is call’d</li>
  <li class="number">The beacon of the wise, the tent that searches</li>
  <li class="number">To th’ bottom of the worst. Let Helen go.</li>
  <li class="number">Since the first sword was drawn about this question,</li>
  <li class="number">Every tithe soul, ’mongst many thousand dismes,</li>
  <li class="number">Hath been as dear as Helen; I mean, of ours.</li>
  <li class="number">If we have lost so many tenths of ours,</li>
  <li class="number">To guard a thing not ours nor worth to us</li>
  <li class="number">(Had it our name) the value of one ten,</li>
  <li class="number">What merit’s in that reason which denies</li>
  <li class="number">The yielding of her up?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TRO.">
  <li class="number">Fie, fie, my brother!</li>
  <li class="number">Weigh you the worth and honor of a king</li>
  <li class="number">So great as our dread father’s in a scale</li>
  <li class="number">Of common ounces? Will you with compters sum</li>
  <li class="number">The past-proportion of his infinite,</li>
  <li class="number">And buckle in a waist most fathomless</li>
  <li class="number">With spans and inches so diminutive</li>
  <li class="number">As fears and reasons? Fie, for godly shame!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HEL.">
  <li class="number">No marvel though you bite so sharp at reasons,</li>
  <li class="number">You are so empty of them. Should not our father</li>
  <li class="number">Bear the great sway of his affairs with reason,</li>
  <li class="number">Because your speech hath none that tell him so?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TRO.">
  <li class="number">You are for dreams and slumbers, brother priest,</li>
  <li class="number">You fur your gloves with reason. Here are your reasons:</li>
  <li class="number">You know an enemy intends you harm;</li>
  <li class="number">You know a sword employ’d is perilous,</li>
  <li class="number">And reason flies the object of all harm.</li>
  <li class="number">Who marvels then, when Helenus beholds</li>
  <li class="number">A Grecian and his sword, if he do set</li>
  <li class="number">The very wings of reason to his heels</li>
  <li class="number">And fly like chidden Mercury from Jove,</li>
  <li class="number">Or like a star disorb’d? Nay, if we talk of reason,</li>
  <li class="number">Let’s shut our gates and sleep. Manhood and honor</li>
  <li class="number">Should have hare hearts, would they but fat their thoughts</li>
  <li class="number">With this cramm’d reason; reason and respect</li>
  <li class="number">Make livers pale and lustihood deject.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HECT.">
  <li class="number">Brother, she is not worth what she doth cost</li>
  <li class="number">The keeping.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TRO.">
  <li class="number">What’s aught but as ’tis valued?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HECT.">
  <li class="number">But value dwells not in particular will,</li>
  <li class="number">It holds his estimate and dignity</li>
  <li class="number">As well wherein ’tis precious of itself</li>
  <li class="number">As in the prizer. ’Tis mad idolatry</li>
  <li class="number">To make the service greater than the god,</li>
  <li class="number">And the will dotes that is attributive</li>
  <li class="number">To what infectiously itself affects,</li>
  <li class="number">Without some image of th’ affected merit.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TRO.">
  <li class="number">I take today a wife, and my election</li>
  <li class="number">Is led on in the conduct of my will,</li>
  <li class="number">My will enkindled by mine eyes and ears,</li>
  <li class="number">Two traded pilots ’twixt the dangerous shores</li>
  <li class="number">Of will and judgment: how may I avoid</li>
  <li class="number">(Although my will distaste what it elected)</li>
  <li class="number">The wife I chose? There can be no evasion</li>
  <li class="number">To blench from this and to stand firm by honor.</li>
  <li class="number">We turn not back the silks upon the merchant</li>
  <li class="number">When we have soil’d them, nor the remainder viands</li>
  <li class="number">We do not throw in unrespective sieve,</li>
  <li class="number">Because we now are full. It was thought meet</li>
  <li class="number">Paris should do some vengeance on the Greeks.</li>
  <li class="number">Your breath with full consent bellied his sails;</li>
  <li class="number">The seas and winds, old wranglers, took a truce,</li>
  <li class="number">And did him service; he touch’d the ports desir’d,</li>
  <li class="number">And for an old aunt whom the Greeks held captive,</li>
  <li class="number">He brought a Grecian queen, whose youth and freshness</li>
  <li class="number">Wrinkles Apollo’s, and makes pale the morning.</li>
  <li class="number">Why keep we her? The Grecians keep our aunt.</li>
  <li class="number">Is she worth keeping? Why, she is a pearl,</li>
  <li class="number">Whose price hath launched above a thousand ships,</li>
  <li class="number">And turn’d crown’d kings to merchants.</li>
  <li class="number">If you’ll avouch ’twas wisdom Paris went—</li>
  <li class="number">As you must needs, for you all cried “Go, go”—</li>
  <li class="number">If you’ll confess he brought home worthy prize—</li>
  <li class="number">As you must needs, for you all clapp’d your hands,</li>
  <li class="number">And cried “Inestimable!”—why do you now</li>
  <li class="number">The issue of your proper wisdoms rate,</li>
  <li class="number">And do a deed that never Fortune did,</li>
  <li class="number">Beggar the estimation which you priz’d</li>
  <li class="number">Richer than sea and land? O theft most base,</li>
  <li class="number">That we have stol’n what we do fear to keep!</li>
  <li class="number">But thieves unworthy of a thing so stol’n,</li>
  <li class="number">That in their country did them that disgrace</li>

<ol data-speaker="TRO.">
  <li class="number">Why, brother Hector,</li>
  <li class="number">We may not think the justness of each act</li>
  <li class="number">Such and no other than event doth form it,</li>
  <li class="number">Nor once deject the courage of our minds</li>

  <li class="number">Cannot distaste the goodness of a quarrel</li>
  <li class="number">Which hath our several honors all engag’d</li>
  <li class="number">To make it gracious. For my private part,</li>
  <li class="number">I am no more touch’d than all Priam’s sons;</li>
  <li class="number">And Jove forbid there should be done amongst us</li>
  <li class="number">Such things as might offend the weakest spleen</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAR.">
  <li class="number">Else might the world convince of levity</li>
  <li class="number">As well my undertakings as your counsels,</li>
  <li class="number">But I attest the gods, your full consent</li>
  <li class="number">Gave wings to my propension, and cut off</li>
  <li class="number">All fears attending on so dire a project.</li>
  <li class="number">For what, alas, can these my single arms?</li>
  <li class="number">What propugnation is in one man’s valor</li>
  <li class="number">To stand the push and enmity of those</li>
  <li class="number">This quarrel would excite? Yet I protest,</li>
  <li class="number">Were I alone to pass the difficulties,</li>
  <li class="number">And had as ample power as I have will,</li>
  <li class="number">Paris should ne’er retract what he hath done,</li>
  <li class="number">Nor faint in the pursuit.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRI.">
  <li class="number">Paris, you speak</li>
  <li class="number">Like one besotted on your sweet delights.</li>
  <li class="number">You have the honey still, but these the gall;</li>
  <li class="number">So to be valiant, is no praise at all.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAR.">
  <li class="number">Sir, I propose not merely to myself</li>
  <li class="number">The pleasures such a beauty brings with it,</li>
  <li class="number">But I would have the soil of her fair rape</li>
  <li class="number">Wip’d off, in honorable keeping her.</li>
  <li class="number">What treason were it to the ransack’d queen,</li>
  <li class="number">Disgrace to your great worths, and shame to me,</li>
  <li class="number">Now to deliver her possession up</li>
  <li class="number">On terms of base compulsion! Can it be</li>
  <li class="number">That so degenerate a strain as this</li>
  <li class="number">Should once set footing in your generous bosoms?</li>
  <li class="number">There’s not the meanest spirit on our party</li>
  <li class="number">Without a heart to dare, or sword to draw,</li>
  <li class="number">When Helen is defended; nor none so noble</li>
  <li class="number">Whose life were ill bestow’d, or death unfam’d,</li>
  <li class="number">Where Helen is the subject. Then I say,</li>
  <li class="number">Well may we fight for her whom we know well</li>
  <li class="number">The world’s large spaces cannot parallel.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HECT.">
  <li class="number">Paris and Troilus, you have both said well,</li>
  <li class="number">And on the cause and question now in hand</li>
  <li class="number">Have gloz’d, but superficially, not much</li>
  <li class="number">Unlike young men, whom Aristotle thought</li>
  <li class="number">Unfit to hear moral philosophy.</li>
  <li class="number">The reasons you allege do more conduce</li>
  <li class="number">To the hot passion of distemp’red blood</li>
  <li class="number">Than to make up a free determination</li>
  <li class="number">’Twixt right and wrong; for pleasure and revenge</li>
  <li class="number">Have ears more deaf than adders to the voice</li>
  <li class="number">Of any true decision. Nature craves</li>
  <li class="number">All dues be rend’red to their owners: now,</li>
  <li class="number">What nearer debt in all humanity</li>
  <li class="number">Than wife is to the husband? If this law</li>
  <li class="number">Of nature be corrupted through affection,</li>
  <li class="number">And that great minds, of partial indulgence</li>
  <li class="number">To their benumbed wills, resist the same,</li>
  <li class="number">There is a law in each well-order’d nation</li>
  <li class="number">To curb those raging appetites that are</li>
  <li class="number">Most disobedient and refractory.</li>
  <li class="number">If Helen then be wife to Sparta’s king,</li>
  <li class="number">As it is known she is, these moral laws</li>
  <li class="number">Of nature and of nations speak aloud</li>
  <li class="number">To have her back return’d. Thus to persist</li>
  <li class="number">In doing wrong extenuates not wrong,</li>
  <li class="number">But makes it much more heavy. Hector’s opinion</li>
  <li class="number">Is this in way of truth; yet ne’er the less,</li>
  <li class="number">My spritely brethren, I propend to you</li>
  <li class="number">In resolution to keep Helen still,</li>
  <li class="number">For ’tis a cause that hath no mean dependance</li>
  <li class="number">Upon our joint and several dignities.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TRO.">
  <li class="number">Why, there you touch’d the life of our design!</li>
  <li class="number">Were it not glory that we more affected</li>
  <li class="number">Than the performance of our heaving spleens,</li>
  <li class="number">I would not wish a drop of Troyan blood</li>
  <li class="number">Spent more in her defense. But, worthy Hector,</li>
  <li class="number">She is a theme of honor and renown,</li>
  <li class="number">A spur to valiant and magnanimous deeds,</li>
  <li class="number">Whose present courage may beat down our foes,</li>
  <li class="number">And fame in time to come canonize us,</li>
  <li class="number">For I presume brave Hector would not lose</li>
  <li class="number">So rich advantage of a promis’d glory</li>
  <li class="number">As smiles upon the forehead of this action</li>
  <li class="number">For the wide world’s revenue.</li>

Would it were otherwise: that I could beat him, whilst he rail’d at me. ’Sfoot, I’ll learn to conjure and raise devils, but I’ll see some issue of my spiteful execrations. Then there’s Achilles, a rare enginer! If Troy be not taken till these two undermine it, the walls will stand till they fall of themselves. 
O thou great thunder-darter of Olympus, forget that thou art Jove, the king of gods, and, Mercury, lose all the serpentine craft of thy caduceus, if ye take not that little little less than little wit from them that they have, which short-arm’d ignorance itself knows is so abundant scarce, it will not in circumvention deliver a fly from a spider, without drawing their massy irons and cutting the web! After this, the vengeance on the whole camp! Or rather, the Neapolitan bone-ache! For that methinks is the curse depending on those that war for a placket.

  <li class="number">What, am I poor of late?</li>
  <li class="number">’Tis certain, greatness, once fall’n out with fortune,</li>
  <li class="number">Must fall out with men too. What the declin’d is,</li>
  <li class="number">He shall as soon read in the eyes of others</li>
  <li class="number">As feel in his own fall; for men, like butterflies,</li>
  <li class="number">Show not their mealy wings but to the summer,</li>
  <li class="number">And not a man, for being simply man,</li>
  <li class="number">Hath any honor, but honor for those honors</li>
  <li class="number">That are without him, as place, riches, and favor—</li>
  <li class="number">Prizes of accident as oft as merit,</li>
  <li class="number">Which when they fall, as being slippery standers,</li>
  <li class="number">The love that lean’d on them as slippery too,</li>
  <li class="number">Doth one pluck down another, and together</li>
  <li class="number">Die in the fall. But ’tis not so with me,</li>
  <li class="number">Fortune and I are friends. I do enjoy</li>
  <li class="number">At ample point all that I did possess,</li>
  <li class="number">Save these men’s looks, who do methinks find out</li>
  <li class="number">Some thing not worth in me such rich beholding</li>
  <li class="number">As they have often given. Here is Ulysses,</li>
  <li class="number">I’ll interrupt his reading.</li>
  <li class="number">How now, Ulysses?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ULYSS.">
  <li class="number">Now, great Thetis’ son!</li>

<ol data-speaker="ACHIL.">
  <li class="number">What are you reading?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ULYSS.">
  <li class="number">A strange fellow here</li>
  <li class="number">Writes me that man, how dearly ever parted,</li>
  <li class="number">How much in having, or without or in,</li>
  <li class="number">Cannot make boast to have that which he hath,</li>
  <li class="number">Nor feels not what he owes, but by reflection;</li>
  <li class="number">As when his virtues, aiming upon others,</li>
  <li class="number">Heat them, and they retort that heat again</li>
  <li class="number">To the first giver.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ACHIL.">
  <li class="number">This is not strange, Ulysses.</li>
  <li class="number">The beauty that is borne here in the face</li>
  <li class="number">The bearer knows not, but commends itself</li>
  <li class="number">To others’ eyes; nor doth the eye itself,</li>
  <li class="number">That most pure spirit of sense, behold itself,</li>
  <li class="number">Not going from itself; but eye to eye opposed,</li>
  <li class="number">Salutes each other with each other’s form;</li>
  <li class="number">For speculation turns not to itself,</li>
  <li class="number">Till it hath travel’d and is mirror’d there</li>
  <li class="number">Where it may see itself. This is not strange at all.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ULYSS.">
  <li class="number">I do not strain at the position—</li>
  <li class="number">It is familiar—but at the author’s drift,</li>
  <li class="number">Who in his circumstance expressly proves</li>
  <li class="number">That no man is the lord of any thing,</li>
  <li class="number">Though in and of him there be much consisting,</li>
  <li class="number">Till he communicate his parts to others;</li>
  <li class="number">Nor doth he of himself know them for aught,</li>
  <li class="number">Till he behold them formed in th’ applause</li>
  <li class="number">Where th’ are extended; who like an arch reverb’rate</li>
  <li class="number">The voice again, or like a gate of steel,</li>
  <li class="number">Fronting the sun, receives and renders back</li>
  <li class="number">His figure and his heat. I was much rapt in this,</li>
  <li class="number">And apprehended here immediately</li>
  <li class="number">Th’ unknown Ajax.</li>
  <li class="number">Heavens, what a man is there! A very horse,</li>
  <li class="number">That has he knows not what. Nature, what things there are</li>
  <li class="number">Most abject in regard, and dear in use!</li>
  <li class="number">What things again most dear in the esteem,</li>
  <li class="number">And poor in worth! Now shall we see tomorrow—</li>
  <li class="number">An act that very chance doth throw upon him—</li>
  <li class="number">Ajax renown’d! O heavens, what some men do,</li>
  <li class="number">While some men leave to do!</li>
  <li class="number">How some men creep in skittish Fortune’s hall,</li>
  <li class="number">Whiles others play the idiots in her eyes!</li>
  <li class="number">How one man eats into another’s pride,</li>
  <li class="number">While pride is fasting in his wantonness!</li>
  <li class="number">To see these Grecian lords!—why, even already</li>
  <li class="number">They clap the lubber Ajax on the shoulder,</li>
  <li class="number">As if his foot were on brave Hector’s breast,</li>
  <li class="number">And great Troy shrieking.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ACHIL.">
  <li class="number">I do believe it, for they pass’d by me</li>
  <li class="number">As misers do by beggars, neither gave to me</li>
  <li class="number">Good word nor look. What, are my deeds forgot?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ULYSS.">
  <li class="number">Time hath, my lord, a wallet at his back,</li>
  <li class="number">Wherein he puts alms for oblivion,</li>
  <li class="number">A great-siz’d monster of ingratitudes.</li>
  <li class="number">Those scraps are good deeds past, which are devour’d</li>
  <li class="number">As fast as they are made, forgot as soon</li>
  <li class="number">As done. Perseverance, dear my lord,</li>
  <li class="number">Keeps honor bright; to have done is to hang</li>
  <li class="number">Quite out of fashion, like a rusty mail</li>
  <li class="number">In monumental mock’ry. Take the instant way,</li>
  <li class="number">For honor travels in a strait so narrow,</li>
  <li class="number">Where one but goes abreast. Keep then the path,</li>
  <li class="number">For emulation hath a thousand sons</li>
  <li class="number">That one by one pursue. If you give way,</li>
  <li class="number">Or hedge aside from the direct forthright,</li>
  <li class="number">Like to an ent’red tide, they all rush by</li>
  <li class="number">And leave you hindmost;</li>
  <li class="number">Or like a gallant horse fall’n in first rank,</li>
  <li class="number">Lie there for pavement to the abject rear,</li>
  <li class="number">O’errun and trampled on. Then what they do in present,</li>
  <li class="number">Though less than yours in past, must o’ertop yours;</li>
  <li class="number">For Time is like a fashionable host</li>
  <li class="number">That slightly shakes his parting guest by th’ hand,</li>
  <li class="number">And with his arms outstretch’d as he would fly,</li>
  <li class="number">Grasps in the comer. The welcome ever smiles,</li>
  <li class="number">And farewell goes out sighing. Let not virtue seek</li>
  <li class="number">Remuneration for the thing it was;</li>
  <li class="number">For beauty, wit,</li>
  <li class="number">High birth, vigor of bone, desert in service,</li>
  <li class="number">Love, friendship, charity, are subjects all</li>
  <li class="number">To envious and calumniating Time.</li>
  <li class="number">One touch of nature makes the whole world kin,</li>
  <li class="number">That all with one consent praise new-born gawds,</li>
  <li class="number">Though they are made and moulded of things past,</li>
  <li class="number">And give to dust, that is a little gilt,</li>
  <li class="number">More laud than gilt o’erdusted.</li>
  <li class="number">The present eye praises the present object.</li>
  <li class="number">Then marvel not, thou great and complete man,</li>
  <li class="number">That all the Greeks begin to worship Ajax;</li>
  <li class="number">Since things in motion sooner catch the eye</li>
  <li class="number">Than what stirs not. The cry went once on thee,</li>
  <li class="number">And still it might, and yet it may again,</li>
  <li class="number">If thou wouldst not entomb thyself alive</li>
  <li class="number">And case thy reputation in thy tent,</li>
  <li class="number">Whose glorious deeds but in these fields of late</li>
  <li class="number">Made emulous missions ’mongst the gods themselves,</li>

<ol data-speaker="ACHIL.">
  <li class="number">What?</li>

<ol data-speaker="ACHIL.">
  <li class="number">How so?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="THER.">
  <li class="number">He must fight singly tomorrow with Hector, and is so prophetically proud of an heroical cudgelling that he raves in saying nothing.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ACHIL.">
  <li class="number">How can that be?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="THER.">
  <li class="number">Why, ’a stalks up and down like a peacock—a stride and a stand; ruminates like an hostess that hath no arithmetic but her brain to set down her reckoning; bites his lip with a politic regard, as who should say there were wit in this head and ’twould out—and so there is; but it lies as coldly in him as fire in a flint, which will not show without knocking. 
The man’s undone forever, for if Hector break not his neck i’ th’ combat, he’ll break’t himself in vainglory. He knows not me. I said, “Good morrow, Ajax”; and he replies, “Thanks, Agamemnon.” 
What think you of this man that takes me for the general? He’s grown a very land-fish, languageless, a monster. A plague of opinion! A man may wear it on both sides, like a leather jerkin.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ACHIL.">
  <li class="number">Thou must be my ambassador to him, Thersites.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="THER.">
  <li class="number">Who, I? Why, he’ll answer nobody; he professes not answering. Speaking is for beggars; he wears his tongue in ’s arms. I will put on his presence, let Patroclus make demands to me; you shall see the pageant of Ajax.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ACHIL.">
  <li class="number">To him, Patroclus. Tell him I humbly desire the valiant Ajax to invite the most valorous Hector to come unarm’d to my tent, and to procure safe-conduct for his person of the magnanimous and most

To an ass, were nothing, he is both ass and ox; to an ox, were nothing, he is both ox and ass. To be a dog, a mule, a cat, a fitchook, a toad, a lizard, an owl, a puttock, or a herring without a roe, I would not care; but to be Menelaus, I would conspire against destiny.
