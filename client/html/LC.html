<h1>A Lover’s Complaint</h1>

  <ol>
    <li>From off a hill whose concave womb reworded</li>
    <li>A plaintful story from a sist’ring vale,</li>
    <li>My spirits t’ attend this double voice accorded,</li>
    <li>And down I laid to list the sad-tun’d tale,</li>
    <li class="number">Ere long espied a fickle maid full pale</li>
    <li>Tearing of papers, breaking rings a-twain,</li>
    <li>Storming her world with sorrow’s wind and rain.</li>
    <li>Upon her head a platted hive of straw,</li>
    <li>Which fortified her visage from the sun,</li>
    <li class="number">Whereon the thought might think sometime it saw</li>
    <li>The carcass of a beauty spent and done.</li>
    <li>Time had not scythed all that youth begun,</li>
    <li>Nor youth all quit, but spite of heaven’s fell rage,</li>
    <li>Some beauty peep’d through lattice of sear’d age.</li>
    <li class="number">Oft did she heave her napkin to her eyne,</li>
    <li>Which on it had conceited characters,</li>
    <li>Laund’ring the silken figures in the brine</li>
    <li>That seasoned woe had pelleted in tears,</li>
    <li>And often reading what contents it bears;</li>
    <li class="number">As often shrieking undistinguish’d woe,</li>
    <li>In clamors of all size, both high and low.</li>
    <li>Sometimes her levell’d eyes their carriage ride,</li>
    <li>As they did batt’ry to the spheres intend;</li>
    <li>Sometime diverted their poor balls are tied</li>
    <li class="number">To th’ orbed earth; sometimes they do extend</li>
    <li>Their view right on; anon their gazes lend</li>
    <li>To every place at once, and no where fix’d,</li>
    <li>The mind and sight distractedly commix’d.</li>
    <li>Her hair, nor loose nor tied in formal plat,</li>
    <li class="number">Proclaim’d in her a careless hand of pride;</li>
    <li>For some untuck’d descended her sheav’d hat,</li>
    <li>Hanging her pale and pined cheek beside;</li>
    <li>Some in her threaden fillet still did bide,</li>
    <li>And true to bondage would not break from thence,</li>
    <li class="number">Though slackly braided in loose negligence.</li>
    <li>A thousand favors from a maund she drew,</li>
    <li>Of amber, crystal, and of beaded jet,</li>
    <li>Which one by one she in a river threw,</li>
    <li>Upon whose weeping margent she was set,</li>
    <li class="number">Like usury applying wet to wet,</li>
    <li>Or monarch’s hands that lets not bounty fall</li>
    <li>Where want cries some, but where excess begs all.</li>
    <li>Of folded schedules had she many a one,</li>
    <li>Which she perus’d, sigh’d, tore, and gave the flood,</li>
    <li class="number">Crack’d many a ring of posied gold and bone,</li>
    <li>Bidding them find their sepulchres in mud,</li>
    <li>Found yet more letters sadly penn’d in blood,</li>
    <li>With sleided silk feat and affectedly</li>
    <li>Enswath’d and seal’d to curious secrecy.</li>
    <li class="number">These often bath’d she in her fluxive eyes,</li>
    <li>And often kiss’d, and often gan to tear;</li>
    <li>Cried, “O false blood, thou register of lies,</li>
    <li>What unapproved witness dost thou bear!</li>
    <li>Ink would have seem’d more black and damned here!”</li>
    <li class="number">This said, in top of rage the lines she rents,</li>
    <li>Big discontent so breaking their contents.</li>
    <li>A reverend man that graz’d his cattle nigh,</li>
    <li>Sometime a blusterer that the ruffle knew</li>
    <li>Of court, of city, and had let go by</li>
    <li class="number">The swiftest hours, observed as they flew,</li>
    <li>Towards this afflicted fancy fastly drew,</li>
    <li>And privileg’d by age desires to know</li>
    <li>In brief the grounds and motives of her woe.</li>
    <li>So slides he down upon his grained bat,</li>
    <li class="number">And comely distant sits he by her side,</li>
    <li>When he again desires her, being sat,</li>
    <li>Her grievance with his hearing to divide:</li>
    <li>If that from him there may be aught applied</li>
    <li>Which may her suffering ecstasy assuage,</li>
    <li class="number">’Tis promis’d in the charity of age.</li>
    <li>“Father,” she says, “though in me you behold</li>
    <li>The injury of many a blasting hour,</li>
    <li>Let it not tell your judgment I am old,</li>
    <li>Not age, but sorrow, over me hath power;</li>
    <li class="number">I might as yet have been a spreading flower,</li>
    <li>Fresh to myself, if I had self-applied</li>
    <li>Love to myself, and to no love beside.</li>
    <li>“But woe is me, too early I attended</li>
    <li>A youthful suit—it was to gain my grace;</li>
    <li class="number">O, one by nature’s outwards so commended</li>
    <li>That maidens’ eyes stuck over all his face.</li>
    <li>Love lack’d a dwelling and made him her place;</li>
    <li>And when in his fair parts she did abide,</li>
    <li>She was new lodg’d and newly deified.</li>
    <li class="number">“His browny locks did hang in crooked curls,</li>
    <li>And every light occasion of the wind</li>
    <li>Upon his lips their silken parcels hurls.</li>
    <li>What’s sweet to do, to do will aptly find:</li>
    <li>Each eye that saw him did enchant the mind,</li>
    <li class="number">For on his visage was in little drawn</li>
    <li>What largeness thinks in Paradise was sawn.</li>
    <li>“Small show of man was yet upon his chin,</li>
    <li>His phoenix down began but to appear</li>
    <li>Like unshorn velvet on that termless skin,</li>
    <li class="number">Whose bare outbragg’d the web it seem’d to wear;</li>
    <li>Yet showed his visage by that cost more dear,</li>
    <li>And nice affections wavering stood in doubt</li>
    <li>If best were as it was, or best without.</li>
    <li>“His qualities were beauteous as his form,</li>
    <li class="number">For maiden-tongu’d he was, and thereof free;</li>
    <li>Yet if men mov’d him, was he such a storm</li>
    <li>As oft ’twixt May and April is to see,</li>
    <li>When winds breathe sweet, unruly though they be.</li>
    <li>His rudeness so with his authoriz’d youth</li>
    <li class="number">Did livery falseness in a pride of truth.</li>
    <li>“Well could he ride, and often men would say,</li>
    <li>‘That horse his mettle from his rider takes;</li>
    <li>Proud of subjection, noble by the sway,</li>
    <li>What rounds, what bounds, what course, what stop he makes!’</li>
    <li class="number">And controversy hence a question takes,</li>
    <li>Whether the horse by him became his deed,</li>
    <li>Or he his manage by th’ well-doing steed.</li>
    <li>“But quickly on this side the verdict went:</li>
    <li>His real habitude gave life and grace</li>
    <li class="number">To appertainings and to ornament,</li>
    <li>Accomplish’d in himself, not in his case;</li>
    <li>All aids, themselves made fairer by their place,</li>
    <li>Came for additions, yet their purpos’d trim</li>
    <li>Piec’d not his grace but were all grac’d by him.</li>
    <li class="number">“So on the tip of his subduing tongue</li>
    <li>All kind of arguments and question deep,</li>
    <li>All replication prompt and reason strong,</li>
    <li>For his advantage still did wake and sleep.</li>
    <li>To make the weeper laugh, the laugher weep,</li>
    <li class="number">He had the dialect and different skill,</li>
    <li>Catching all passions in his craft of will,</li>
    <li>“That he did in the general bosom reign</li>
    <li>Of young, of old, and sexes both enchanted,</li>
    <li>To dwell with him in thoughts, or to remain</li>
    <li class="number">In personal duty, following where he haunted.</li>
    <li>Consents bewitch’d, ere he desire, have granted,</li>
    <li>And dialogu’d for him what he would say,</li>
    <li>Ask’d their own wills and made their wills obey.</li>
    <li>“Many there were that did his picture get</li>
    <li class="number">To serve their eyes, and in it put their mind,</li>
    <li>Like fools that in th’ imagination set</li>
    <li>The goodly objects which abroad they find</li>
    <li>Of lands and mansions, theirs in thought assign’d,</li>
    <li>And laboring in more pleasures to bestow them</li>
    <li class="number">Than the true gouty landlord which doth owe them.</li>
    <li>“So many have that never touch’d his hand</li>
    <li>Sweetly suppos’d them mistress of his heart.</li>
    <li>My woeful self that did in freedom stand,</li>
    <li>And was my own fee-simple (not in part),</li>
    <li class="number">What with his art in youth and youth in art,</li>
    <li>Threw my affections in his charmed power,</li>
    <li>Reserv’d the stalk and gave him all my flower.</li>
    <li>“Yet did I not as some my equals did</li>
    <li>Demand of him, nor being desired yielded;</li>
    <li class="number">Finding myself in honor so forbid,</li>
    <li>With safest distance I mine honor shielded.</li>
    <li>Experience for me many bulwarks builded</li>
    <li>Of proofs new-bleeding which remain’d the foil</li>
    <li>Of this false jewel, and his amorous spoil.</li>
    <li class="number">“But ah, who ever shunn’d by precedent</li>
    <li>The destin’d ill she must herself assay,</li>
    <li>Or forc’d examples ’gainst her own content</li>
    <li>To put the by-past perils in her way?</li>
    <li>Counsel may stop a while what will not stay;</li>
    <li class="number">For when we rage, advice is often seen</li>
    <li>By blunting us to make our wits more keen.</li>
    <li>“Nor gives it satisfaction to our blood</li>
    <li>That we must curb it upon others’ proof,</li>
    <li>To be forbod the sweets that seems so good</li>
    <li class="number">For fear of harms that preach in our behoof.</li>
    <li>O appetite, from judgment stand aloof!</li>
    <li>The one a palate hath that needs will taste,</li>
    <li>Though Reason weep and cry, ‘It is thy last.’</li>
    <li>“For further I could say this man’s untrue,</li>
    <li class="number">And knew the patterns of his foul beguiling,</li>
    <li>Heard where his plants in others’ orchards grew,</li>
    <li>Saw how deceits were gilded in his smiling,</li>
    <li>Knew vows were ever brokers to defiling,</li>
    <li>Thought characters and words merely but art,</li>
    <li class="number">And bastards of his foul adulterate heart.</li>
    <li>“And long upon these terms I held my city,</li>
    <li>Till thus he gan besiege me: ‘Gentle maid,</li>
    <li>Have of my suffering youth some feeling pity</li>
    <li>And be not of my holy vows afraid.</li>
    <li class="number">That’s to ye sworn to none was ever said,</li>
    <li>For feasts of love I have been call’d unto,</li>
    <li>Till now did ne’er invite nor never vow.</li>
    <li>“‘All my offenses that abroad you see</li>
    <li>Are errors of the blood, none of the mind;</li>
    <li class="number">Love made them not, with acture they may be,</li>
    <li>Where neither party is nor true nor kind:</li>
    <li>They sought their shame that so their shame did find,</li>
    <li>And so much less of shame in me remains</li>
    <li>By how much of me their reproach contains.</li>
    <li class="number">“‘Among the many that mine eyes have seen,</li>
    <li>Not one whose flame my heart so much as warmed,</li>
    <li>Or my affection put to th’ smallest teen,</li>
    <li>Or any of my leisures ever charmed.</li>
    <li>Harm have I done to them but ne’er was harmed,</li>
    <li class="number">Kept hearts in liveries, but mine own was free,</li>
    <li>And reign’d commanding in his monarchy.</li>
    <li>“‘Look here what tributes wounded fancies sent me,</li>
    <li>Of pallid pearls and rubies red as blood:</li>
    <li>Figuring that they their passions likewise lent me</li>
    <li class="number">Of grief and blushes, aptly understood</li>
    <li>In bloodless white and the encrimson’d mood,</li>
    <li>Effects of terror and dear modesty,</li>
    <li>Encamp’d in hearts but fighting outwardly.</li>
    <li>“‘And lo behold these talents of their hair,</li>
    <li class="number">With twisted metal amorously impleach’d,</li>
    <li>I have receiv’d from many a several fair,</li>
    <li>Their kind acceptance weepingly beseech’d,</li>
    <li>With th’ annexions of fair gems enrich’d,</li>
    <li>And deep-brain’d sonnets that did amplify</li>
    <li class="number">Each stone’s dear nature, worth, and quality.</li>
    <li>“‘The diamond? Why, ’twas beautiful and hard,</li>
    <li>Whereto his invis’d properties did tend;</li>
    <li>The deep-green em’rald, in whose fresh regard</li>
    <li>Weak sights their sickly radiance do amend;</li>
    <li class="number">The heaven-hu’d sapphire and the opal blend</li>
    <li>With objects manifold: each several stone,</li>
    <li>With wit well blazon’d, smil’d or made some moan.</li>
    <li>“‘Lo all these trophies of affections hot,</li>
    <li>Of pensiv’d and subdu’d desires the tender,</li>
    <li class="number">Nature hath charg’d me that I hoard them not,</li>
    <li>But yield them up where I myself must render:</li>
    <li>That is to you, my origin and ender;</li>
    <li>For these of force must your oblations be,</li>
    <li>Since I their altar, you enpatron me.</li>
    <li class="number">“‘O then advance (of yours) that phraseless hand,</li>
    <li>Whose white weighs down the airy scale of praise,</li>
    <li>Take all these similes to your own command,</li>
    <li>Hallowed with sighs that burning lungs did raise;</li>
    <li>What me, your minister, for you obeys,</li>
    <li class="number">Works under you, and to your audit comes</li>
    <li>Their distract parcels in combined sums.</li>
    <li>“‘Lo this device was sent me from a nun,</li>
    <li>Or sister sanctified, of holiest note,</li>
    <li>Which late her noble suit in court did shun,</li>
    <li class="number">Whose rarest havings made the blossoms dote,</li>
    <li>For she was sought by spirits of richest coat,</li>
    <li>But kept cold distance, and did thence remove</li>
    <li>To spend her living in eternal love.</li>
    <li>“‘But, O my sweet, what labor is’t to leave</li>
    <li class="number">The thing we have not, mast’ring what not strives,</li>
    <li>Playing the place which did no form receive,</li>
    <li>Playing patient sports in unconstrained gyves?</li>
    <li>She that her fame so to herself contrives,</li>
    <li>The scars of battle scapeth by the flight,</li>
    <li class="number">And makes her absence valiant, not her might.</li>
    <li>“‘O, pardon me, in that my boast is true:</li>
    <li>The accident which brought me to her eye</li>
    <li>Upon the moment did her force subdue,</li>
    <li>And now she would the caged cloister fly:</li>
    <li class="number">Religious love put out religion’s eye.</li>
    <li>Not to be tempted would she be enur’d,</li>
    <li>And now to tempt all liberty procur’d.</li>
    <li>“‘How mighty then you are, O, hear me tell!</li>
    <li>The broken bosoms that to me belong</li>
    <li class="number">Have emptied all their fountains in my well,</li>
    <li>And mine I pour your ocean all among:</li>
    <li>I strong o’er them, and you o’er me being strong,</li>
    <li>Must for your victory us all congest,</li>
    <li>As compound love to physic your cold breast.</li>
    <li class="number">“‘My parts had pow’r to charm a sacred nun,</li>
    <li>Who disciplin’d, ay, dieted in grace,</li>
    <li>Believ’d her eyes when they t’ assail begun,</li>
    <li>All vows and consecrations giving place.</li>
    <li>O most potential love! Vow, bond, nor space</li>
    <li class="number">In thee hath neither sting, knot, nor confine,</li>
    <li>For thou art all, and all things else are thine.</li>
    <li>“‘When thou impressest, what are precepts worth</li>
    <li>Of stale example? When thou wilt inflame,</li>
    <li>How coldly those impediments stand forth</li>
    <li class="number">Of wealth, of filial fear, law, kindred, fame!</li>
    <li>Love’s arms are peace, ’gainst rule, ’gainst sense, ’gainst shame,</li>
    <li>And sweetens, in the suff’ring pangs it bears,</li>
    <li>The aloes of all forces, shocks, and fears.</li>
    <li>“‘Now all these hearts that do on mine depend,</li>
    <li class="number">Feeling it break, with bleeding groans they pine,</li>
    <li>And supplicant their sighs to you extend</li>
    <li>To leave the batt’ry that you make ’gainst mine,</li>
    <li>Lending soft audience to my sweet design,</li>
    <li>And credent soul to that strong-bonded oath</li>
    <li class="number">That shall prefer and undertake my troth.’</li>
    <li>“This said, his wat’ry eyes he did dismount,</li>
    <li>Whose sights till then were levell’d on my face,</li>
    <li>Each cheek a river running from a fount</li>
    <li>With brinish current downward flow’d apace:</li>
    <li class="number">O how the channel to the stream gave grace!</li>
    <li>Who glaz’d with crystal gate the glowing roses</li>
    <li>That flame through water which their hue encloses.</li>
    <li>“O father, what a hell of witchcraft lies</li>
    <li>In the small orb of one particular tear!</li>
    <li class="number">But with the inundation of the eyes</li>
    <li>What rocky heart to water will not wear?</li>
    <li>What breast so cold that is not warmed here?</li>
    <li>O cleft effect! Cold modesty, hot wrath,</li>
    <li>Both fire from hence and chill extincture hath.</li>
    <li class="number">“For lo his passion, but an art of craft,</li>
    <li>Even there resolv’d my reason into tears,</li>
    <li>There my white stole of chastity I daff’d,</li>
    <li>Shook off my sober guards and civil fears;</li>
    <li>Appear to him as he to me appears,</li>
    <li class="number">All melting, though our drops this diff’rence bore:</li>
    <li>His poison’d me, and mine did him restore.</li>
    <li>“In him a plenitude of subtle matter,</li>
    <li>Applied to cautels, all strange forms receives,</li>
    <li>Of burning blushes, or of weeping water,</li>
    <li class="number">Or sounding paleness; and he takes and leaves,</li>
    <li>In either’s aptness as it best deceives,</li>
    <li>To blush at speeches rank, to weep at woes,</li>
    <li>Or to turn white and sound at tragic shows;</li>
    <li>“That not a heart which in his level came</li>
    <li class="number">Could scape the hail of his all-hurting aim,</li>
    <li>Showing fair nature is both kind and tame;</li>
    <li>And veil’d in them did win whom he would maim.</li>
    <li>Against the thing he sought he would exclaim:</li>
    <li>When he most burnt in heart-wish’d luxury,</li>
    <li class="number">He preach’d pure maid, and prais’d cold chastity.</li>
    <li>“Thus merely with the garment of a Grace</li>
    <li>The naked and concealed fiend he cover’d,</li>
    <li>That th’ unexperient gave the tempter place,</li>
    <li>Which like a cherubin above them hover’d.</li>
    <li class="number">Who, young and simple, would not be so lover’d?</li>
    <li>Ay me, I fell, and yet do question make</li>
    <li>What I should do again for such a sake.</li>
    <li>“O, that infected moisture of his eye,</li>
    <li>O, that false fire which in his cheek so glowed,</li>
    <li class="number">O, that forc’d thunder from his heart did fly,</li>
    <li>O, that sad breath his spungy lungs bestowed,</li>
    <li>O, all that borrowed motion seeming owed,</li>
    <li>Would yet again betray the fore-betray’d,</li>
    <li>And new pervert a reconciled maid!”</li>
