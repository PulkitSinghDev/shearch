  <li class="number">Hung be the heavens with black, yield day to night!</li>
  <li class="number">Comets, importing change of times and states,</li>
  <li class="number">Brandish your crystal tresses in the sky,</li>
  <li class="number">And with them scourge the bad revolting stars</li>
  <li class="number">That have consented unto Henry’s death:</li>
  <li class="number">King Henry the Fifth, too famous to live long!</li>
  <li class="number">England ne’er lost a king of so much worth.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li class="number">England ne’er had a king until his time:</li>
  <li class="number">Virtue he had, deserving to command;</li>
  <li class="number">His brandish’d sword did blind men with his beams;</li>
  <li class="number">His arms spread wider than a dragon’s wings;</li>
  <li class="number">His sparkling eyes, replete with wrathful fire,</li>
  <li class="number">More dazzled and drove back his enemies</li>
  <li class="number">Than midday sun fierce bent against their faces.</li>
  <li class="number">What should I say? His deeds exceed all speech:</li>
  <li class="number">He ne’er lift up his hand but conquered.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="EXE.">
  <li class="number">We mourn in black, why mourn we not in blood?</li>
  <li class="number">Henry is dead, and never shall revive.</li>
  <li class="number">Upon a wooden coffin we attend,</li>
  <li class="number">And death’s dishonorable victory</li>
  <li class="number">We with our stately presence glorify,</li>
  <li class="number">Like captives bound to a triumphant car.</li>
  <li class="number">What? Shall we curse the planets of mishap</li>
  <li class="number">That plotted thus our glory’s overthrow?</li>
  <li class="number">Or shall we think the subtile-witted French</li>
  <li class="number">Conjurers and sorcerers, that, afraid of him,</li>
  <li class="number">By magic verses have contriv’d his end?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WIN.">
  <li class="number">He was a king blest of the King of kings.</li>
  <li class="number">Unto the French the dreadful Judgment Day</li>
  <li class="number">So dreadful will not be as was his sight.</li>
  <li class="number">The battles of the Lord of hosts he fought;</li>
  <li class="number">The Church’s prayers made him so prosperous.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li class="number">The Church? Where is it? Had not churchmen pray’d,</li>
  <li class="number">His thread of life had not so soon decay’d.</li>
  <li class="number">None do you like but an effeminate prince,</li>
  <li class="number">Whom like a schoolboy you may overawe.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WIN.">
  <li class="number">Gloucester, what e’er we like, thou art Protector,</li>

<ol data-speaker="BED.">
  <li class="number">Cease, cease these jars and rest your minds in peace.</li>
  <li class="number">Let’s to the altar. Heralds, wait on us.</li>
  <li class="number">In stead of gold, we’ll offer up our arms,</li>
  <li class="number">Since arms avail not now that Henry’s dead.</li>
  <li class="number">Posterity, await for wretched years,</li>
  <li class="number">When at their mothers’ moist’ned eyes babes shall suck,</li>
  <li class="number">Our isle be made a nourish of salt tears,</li>
  <li class="number">And none but women left to wail the dead.</li>
  <li class="number">Henry the Fifth, thy ghost I invocate:</li>
  <li class="number">Prosper this realm, keep it from civil broils,</li>
  <li class="number">Combat with adverse planets in the heavens!</li>
  <li class="number">A far more glorious star thy soul will make</li>

  <li class="number">My honorable lords, health to you all!</li>

  <li class="number">My gracious lords, to add to your laments,</li>
  <li class="number">Wherewith you now bedew King Henry’s hearse,</li>
  <li class="number">I must inform you of a dismal fight</li>
  <li class="number">Betwixt the stout Lord Talbot and the French.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WIN.">
  <li class="number">What? Wherein Talbot overcame, is’t so?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="3. MESS.">
  <li class="number">O no; wherein Lord Talbot was o’er-thrown.</li>
  <li class="number">The circumstance I’ll tell you more at large.</li>
  <li class="number">The tenth of August last this dreadful lord,</li>
  <li class="number">Retiring from the siege of Orléans,</li>
  <li class="number">Having full scarce six thousand in his troop,</li>
  <li class="number">By three and twenty thousand of the French</li>
  <li class="number">Was round encompassed, and set upon.</li>
  <li class="number">No leisure had he to enrank his men;</li>
  <li class="number">He wanted pikes to set before his archers;</li>
  <li class="number">In stead whereof sharp stakes pluck’d out of hedges</li>
  <li class="number">They pitched in the ground confusedly,</li>
  <li class="number">To keep the horsemen off from breaking in.</li>
  <li class="number">More than three hours the fight continued,</li>
  <li class="number">Where valiant Talbot above human thought</li>
  <li class="number">Enacted wonders with his sword and lance:</li>
  <li class="number">Hundreds he sent to hell, and none durst stand him;</li>
  <li class="number">Here, there, and every where, enrag’d he slew.</li>
  <li class="number">The French exclaim’d, the devil was in arms;</li>
  <li class="number">All the whole army stood agaz’d on him.</li>
  <li class="number">His soldiers, spying his undaunted spirit,</li>
  <li class="number">“A Talbot! A Talbot!” cried out amain,</li>
  <li class="number">And rush’d into the bowels of the battle.</li>
  <li class="number">Here had the conquest fully been seal’d up,</li>
  <li class="number">If Sir John Falstaff had not play’d the coward.</li>
  <li class="number">He, being in the vaward, plac’d behind</li>
  <li class="number">With purpose to relieve and follow them,</li>
  <li class="number">Cowardly fled, not having struck one stroke.</li>
  <li class="number">Hence grew the general wrack and massacre;</li>
  <li class="number">Enclosed were they with their enemies.</li>
  <li class="number">A base Wallon, to win the Dauphin’s grace,</li>
  <li class="number">Thrust Talbot with a spear into the back,</li>
  <li class="number">Whom all France with their chief assembled strength</li>
  <li class="number">Durst not presume to look once in the face.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BED.">
  <li class="number">Is Talbot slain then? I will slay myself</li>
  <li class="number">For living idly here in pomp and ease,</li>
  <li class="number">Whilst such a worthy leader, wanting aid,</li>
  <li class="number">Unto his dastard foemen is betray’d.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="3. MESS.">
  <li class="number">O no, he lives, but is took prisoner,</li>
  <li class="number">And Lord Scales with him, and Lord Hungerford.</li>
  <li class="number">Most of the rest slaughter’d or took likewise.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BED.">
  <li class="number">His ransom there is none but I shall pay:</li>
  <li class="number">I’ll hale the Dauphin headlong from his throne,</li>
  <li class="number">His crown shall be the ransom of my friend;</li>
  <li class="number">Four of their lords I’ll change for one of ours.</li>
  <li class="number">Farewell, my masters, to my task will I.</li>
  <li class="number">Bonfires in France forthwith I am to make,</li>
  <li class="number">To keep our great Saint George’s feast withal.</li>
  <li class="number">Ten thousand soldiers with me I will take,</li>
  <li class="number">Whose bloody deeds shall make all Europe quake.</li>

<ol data-speaker="ALAN.">
  <li class="number">They want their porridge and their fat bull-beeves:</li>

  <li class="number">Great lords and gentlemen, what means this silence?</li>

  <li class="number">Leaving no heir begotten of his body)</li>
  <li class="number">I was the next by birth and parentage;</li>

  <li class="number">But mark: as in this haughty great attempt</li>

		KING.

</div>

<ol data-speaker="KING.">
  <li class="number">Your wondrous rare description, noble Earl,</li>
  <li class="number">Of beauteous Margaret hath astonish’d me.</li>
  <li class="number">Her virtues, graced with external gifts,</li>
  <li class="number">Do breed love’s settled passions in my heart,</li>
  <li class="number">And like as rigor of tempestuous gusts</li>
  <li class="number">Provokes the mightiest hulk against the tide,</li>
  <li class="number">So am I driven by breath of her renown,</li>
  <li class="number">Either to suffer shipwrack, or arrive</li>
  <li class="number">Where I may have fruition of her love.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SUF.">
  <li class="number">Tush, my good lord, this superficial tale</li>
  <li class="number">Is but a preface of her worthy praise.</li>
  <li class="number">The chief perfections of that lovely dame</li>
  <li class="number">(Had I sufficient skill to utter them)</li>
  <li class="number">Would make a volume of enticing lines,</li>
  <li class="number">Able to ravish any dull conceit;</li>
  <li class="number">And, which is more, she is not so divine,</li>
  <li class="number">So full replete with choice of all delights,</li>
  <li class="number">But with as humble lowliness of mind</li>
  <li class="number">She is content to be at your command—</li>
  <li class="number">Command, I mean, of virtuous chaste intents,</li>
  <li class="number">To love and honor Henry as her lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING.">
  <li class="number">And otherwise will Henry ne’er presume.</li>
  <li class="number">Therefore, my Lord Protector, give consent</li>
  <li class="number">That Marg’ret may be England’s royal queen.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li class="number">So should I give consent to flatter sin.</li>
  <li class="number">You know, my lord, your Highness is betroth’d</li>
  <li class="number">Unto another lady of esteem.</li>
  <li class="number">How shall we then dispense with that contract,</li>
  <li class="number">And not deface your honor with reproach?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SUF.">
  <li class="number">As doth a ruler with unlawful oaths,</li>
  <li class="number">Or one that at a triumph, having vow’d</li>
  <li class="number">To try his strength, forsaketh yet the lists</li>
  <li class="number">By reason of his adversary’s odds.</li>
  <li class="number">A poor earl’s daughter is unequal odds,</li>
  <li class="number">And therefore may be broke without offense.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li class="number">Why, what, I pray, is Margaret more than that?</li>
  <li class="number">Her father is no better than an earl,</li>
  <li class="number">Although in glorious titles he excel.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SUF.">
  <li class="number">Yes, my lord, her father is a king,</li>
  <li class="number">The King of Naples and Jerusalem,</li>
  <li class="number">And of such great authority in France</li>
  <li class="number">As his alliance will confirm our peace,</li>
  <li class="number">And keep the Frenchmen in allegiance.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li class="number">And so the Earl of Armagnac may do,</li>
  <li class="number">Because he is near kinsman unto Charles.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="EXE.">
  <li class="number">Beside, his wealth doth warrant a liberal dower,</li>
  <li class="number">Where Reignier sooner will receive than give.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SUF.">
  <li class="number">A dow’r, my lords? Disgrace not so your king,</li>
  <li class="number">That he should be so abject, base, and poor,</li>
  <li class="number">To choose for wealth and not for perfect love.</li>
  <li class="number">Henry is able to enrich his queen,</li>
  <li class="number">And not to seek a queen to make him rich:</li>
  <li class="number">So worthless peasants bargain for their wives,</li>
  <li class="number">As market men for oxen, sheep, or horse.</li>
  <li class="number">Marriage is a matter of more worth</li>
  <li class="number">Than to be dealt in by attorneyship.</li>
  <li class="number">Not whom we will, but whom his Grace affects,</li>
  <li class="number">Must be companion of his nuptial bed.</li>
  <li class="number">And therefore, lords, since he affects her most,</li>
  <li class="number">Most of all these reasons bindeth us</li>
  <li class="number">In our opinions she should be preferr’d.</li>
  <li class="number">For what is wedlock forced, but a hell,</li>
  <li class="number">An age of discord and continual strife?</li>
  <li class="number">Whereas the contrary bringeth bliss,</li>
  <li class="number">And is a pattern of celestial peace.</li>
  <li class="number">Whom should we match with Henry, being a king,</li>
  <li class="number">But Margaret, that is daughter to a king?</li>
  <li class="number">Her peerless feature, joined with her birth,</li>
  <li class="number">Approves her fit for none but for a king.</li>
  <li class="number">Her valiant courage and undaunted spirit</li>
  <li class="number">(More than in women commonly is seen)</li>
  <li class="number">Will answer our hope in issue of a king;</li>
  <li class="number">For Henry, son unto a conqueror,</li>
  <li class="number">Is likely to beget more conquerors,</li>
  <li class="number">If with a lady of so high resolve</li>
  <li class="number">(As is fair Margaret) he be link’d in love.</li>
  <li class="number">Then yield, my lords, and here conclude with me</li>
  <li class="number">That Margaret shall be Queen, and none but she.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KING.">
  <li class="number">Whether it be through force of your report,</li>
  <li class="number">My noble Lord of Suffolk, or for that</li>
  <li class="number">My tender youth was never yet attaint</li>
  <li class="number">With any passion of inflaming love,</li>
  <li class="number">I cannot tell; but this I am assur’d,</li>
  <li class="number">I feel such sharp dissension in my breast,</li>
  <li class="number">Such fierce alarums both of hope and fear,</li>
  <li class="number">As I am sick with working of my thoughts.</li>
  <li class="number">Take therefore shipping, post, my lord, to France,</li>
  <li class="number">Agree to any covenants, and procure</li>
  <li class="number">That Lady Margaret do vouchsafe to come</li>
  <li class="number">To cross the seas to England and be crown’d</li>
  <li class="number">King Henry’s faithful and anointed queen.</li>
  <li class="number">For your expenses and sufficient charge,</li>
  <li class="number">Among the people gather up a tenth.</li>
  <li class="number">Be gone, I say, for till you do return,</li>
  <li class="number">I rest perplexed with a thousand cares.</li>
  <li class="number">And you, good uncle, banish all offense.</li>
  <li class="number">If you do censure me by what you were,</li>
  <li class="number">Not what you are, I know it will excuse</li>
  <li class="number">This sudden execution of my will.</li>
