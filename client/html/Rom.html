  <li class="number">Gregory, on my word, we’ll not carry coals.</li>

<ol data-speaker="GRE.">
  <li class="number">No, for then we should be colliers.</li>

<ol data-speaker="SAM.">
  <li class="number">I mean, and we be in choler, we’ll draw.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GRE.">
  <li class="number">Ay, while you live, draw your neck out of collar.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SAM.">
  <li class="number">I strike quickly, being mov’d.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GRE.">
  <li class="number">But thou art not quickly mov’d to strike.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SAM.">
  <li class="number">A dog of the house of Montague moves me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GRE.">
  <li class="number">To move is to stir, and to be valiant is to stand; therefore, if thou art mov’d, thou run’st away.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SAM.">
  <li class="number">A dog of that house shall move me to stand! I will take the wall of any man or maid of Montague’s.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GRE.">
  <li class="number">That shows thee a weak slave, for the weakest goes to the wall.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SAM.">
  <li class="number">’Tis true, and therefore women, being the weaker vessels, are ever thrust to the wall; therefore I will push Montague’s men from the wall, and thrust his maids to the wall.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GRE.">
  <li class="number">The quarrel is between our masters, and us their men.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SAM.">
  <li class="number">’Tis all one; I will show myself a tyrant: when I have fought with the men, I will be civil with the maids; I will cut off their heads.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GRE.">
  <li class="number">The heads of the maids?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SAM.">
  <li class="number">Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads, take it in what sense thou wilt.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GRE.">
  <li class="number">They must take it in sense that feel it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SAM.">
  <li class="number">Me they shall feel while I am able to stand, and ’tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GRE.">
  <li class="number">’Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou hadst been poor-John. Draw thy tool, here comes two of the house of Montagues.</li>

  <li class="number">Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them, which is disgrace to them if they bear it.</li>

<ol data-speaker="BEN.">
  <li class="number">Here were the servants of your adversary,</li>
  <li class="number">And yours, close fighting ere I did approach.</li>
  <li class="number">I drew to part them. In the instant came</li>
  <li class="number">The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepar’d,</li>
  <li class="number">Which, as he breath’d defiance to my ears,</li>
  <li class="number">He swung about his head and cut the winds,</li>
  <li class="number">Who, nothing hurt withal, hiss’d him in scorn.</li>
  <li class="number">While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,</li>
  <li class="number">Came more and more, and fought on part and part,</li>

<ol data-speaker="LA. MON.">
  <li class="number">O, where is Romeo? Saw you him today?</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BEN.">
  <li class="number">Madam, an hour before the worshipp’d sun</li>
  <li class="number">Peer’d forth the golden window of the east,</li>
  <li class="number">A troubled mind drive me to walk abroad,</li>
  <li class="number">Where, underneath the grove of sycamore</li>
  <li class="number">That westward rooteth from this city side,</li>
  <li class="number">So early walking did I see your son.</li>
  <li class="number">Towards him I made, but he was ware of me,</li>
  <li class="number">And stole into the covert of the wood.</li>
  <li class="number">I, measuring his affections by my own,</li>
  <li class="number">Which then most sought where most might not be found,</li>
  <li class="number">Being one too many by my weary self,</li>
  <li class="number">Pursued my humor not pursuing his,</li>
  <li class="number">And gladly shunn’d who gladly fled from me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MON.">
  <li class="number">Many a morning hath he there been seen,</li>
  <li class="number">With tears augmenting the fresh morning’s dew,</li>
  <li class="number">Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs,</li>
  <li class="number">But all so soon as the all-cheering sun</li>
  <li class="number">Should in the farthest east begin to draw</li>
  <li class="number">The shady curtains from Aurora’s bed,</li>
  <li class="number">Away from light steals home my heavy son,</li>
  <li class="number">And private in his chamber pens himself,</li>
  <li class="number">Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight out,</li>
  <li class="number">And makes himself an artificial night.</li>
  <li class="number">Black and portendous must this humor prove,</li>
  <li class="number">Unless good counsel may the cause remove.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BEN.">
  <li class="number">My noble uncle, do you know the cause?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MON.">
  <li class="number">I neither know it, nor can learn of him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BEN.">
  <li class="number">Have you importun’d him by any means?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MON.">
  <li class="number">Both by myself and many other friends,</li>
  <li class="number">But he, his own affections’ counsellor,</li>
  <li class="number">Is to himself (I will not say how true)</li>
  <li class="number">But to himself so secret and so close,</li>
  <li class="number">So far from sounding and discovery,</li>
  <li class="number">As is the bud bit with an envious worm,</li>
  <li class="number">Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air</li>
  <li class="number">Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.</li>
  <li class="number">Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow,</li>
  <li class="number">We would as willingly give cure as know.</li>

<ol data-speaker="ROM.">
  <li class="number">Is the day so young?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BEN.">
  <li class="number">But new struck nine.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROM.">
  <li class="number">Ay me, sad hours seem long.</li>
  <li class="number">Was that my father that went hence so fast?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BEN.">
  <li class="number">It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo’s hours?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROM.">
  <li class="number">Not having that which, having, makes them short.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BEN.">
  <li class="number">In love?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROM.">
  <li class="number">Out—</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BEN.">
  <li class="number">Of love?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROM.">
  <li class="number">Out of her favor where I am in love.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BEN.">
  <li class="number">Alas that love, so gentle in his view,</li>
  <li class="number">Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROM.">
  <li class="number">Alas that love, whose view is muffled still,</li>
  <li class="number">Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!</li>
  <li class="number">Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?</li>
  <li class="number">Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all:</li>
  <li class="number">Here’s much to do with hate, but more with love.</li>
  <li class="number">Why then, O brawling love! O loving hate!</li>
  <li class="number">O any thing, of nothing first create!</li>
  <li class="number">O heavy lightness, serious vanity,</li>
  <li class="number">Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms,</li>
  <li class="number">Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health,</li>
  <li class="number">Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!</li>
  <li class="number">This love feel I, that feel no love in this.</li>
  <li class="number">Dost thou not laugh?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BEN.">
  <li class="number">No, coz, I rather weep.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROM.">
  <li class="number">Good heart, at what?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BEN.">
  <li class="number">At thy good heart’s oppression.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROM.">
  <li class="number">Why, such is love’s transgression.</li>
  <li class="number">Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,</li>
  <li class="number">Which thou wilt propagate to have it press’d</li>
  <li class="number">With more of thine. This love that thou hast shown</li>
  <li class="number">Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.</li>
  <li class="number">Love is a smoke made with the fume of sighs,</li>
  <li class="number">Being purg’d, a fire sparkling in lovers’ eyes,</li>
  <li class="number">Being vex’d, a sea nourish’d with loving tears.</li>
  <li class="number">What is it else? A madness most discreet,</li>
  <li class="number">A choking gall, and a preserving sweet.</li>
  <li class="number">Farewell, my coz.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BEN.">
  <li class="number">Soft, I will go along;</li>
  <li class="number">And if you leave me so, you do me wrong.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROM.">
  <li class="number">Tut, I have lost myself, I am not here:</li>
  <li class="number">This is not Romeo, he’s some other where.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BEN.">
  <li class="number">Tell me in sadness, who is that you love?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROM.">
  <li class="number">What, shall I groan and tell thee?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BEN.">
  <li class="number">Groan? Why, no;</li>
  <li class="number">But sadly tell me, who?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROM.">
  <li class="number">Bid a sick man in sadness make his will—</li>
  <li class="number">A word ill urg’d to one that is so ill!</li>
  <li class="number">In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BEN.">
  <li class="number">I aim’d so near when I suppos’d you lov’d.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROM.">
  <li class="number">A right good mark-man! And she’s fair I love.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BEN.">
  <li class="number">A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROM.">
  <li class="number">Well, in that hit you miss: she’ll not be hit</li>
  <li class="number">With Cupid’s arrow, she hath Dian’s wit;</li>
  <li class="number">And in strong proof of chastity well arm’d,</li>
  <li class="number">From Love’s weak childish bow she lives uncharm’d.</li>
  <li class="number">She will not stay the siege of loving terms,</li>
  <li class="number">Nor bide th’ encounter of assailing eyes,</li>
  <li class="number">Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold.</li>
  <li class="number">O, she is rich in beauty, only poor</li>
  <li class="number">That, when she dies, with beauty dies her store.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BEN.">
  <li class="number">Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROM.">
  <li class="number">She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste;</li>
  <li class="number">For beauty starv’d with her severity</li>
  <li class="number">Cuts beauty off from all posterity.</li>
  <li class="number">She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,</li>
  <li class="number">To merit bliss by making me despair.</li>
  <li class="number">She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow</li>
  <li class="number">Do I live dead that live to tell it now.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BEN.">
  <li class="number">Be rul’d by me, forget to think of her.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROM.">
  <li class="number">O, teach me how I should forget to think.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BEN.">
  <li class="number">By giving liberty unto thine eyes:</li>
  <li class="number">Examine other beauties.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROM.">
  <li class="number">’Tis the way</li>
  <li class="number">To call hers (exquisite) in question more.</li>
  <li class="number">These happy masks that kiss fair ladies’ brows,</li>
  <li class="number">Being black, puts us in mind they hide the fair.</li>
  <li class="number">He that is strucken blind cannot forget</li>
  <li class="number">The precious treasure of his eyesight lost.</li>
  <li class="number">Show me a mistress that is passing fair,</li>
  <li class="number">What doth her beauty serve but as a note</li>
  <li class="number">Where I may read who pass’d that passing fair?</li>
  <li class="number">Farewell, thou canst not teach me to forget.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BEN.">

  <li class="number">With love’s light wings did I o’erperch these walls,</li>

  <li class="number">Romeo, come forth, come forth, thou fearful man:</li>
  <li class="number">Affliction is enamor’d of thy parts,</li>
  <li class="number">And thou art wedded to calamity.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">

<ol data-speaker="ROM.">
  <li class="number">Father, what news? What is the Prince’s doom?</li>
  <li class="number">What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand,</li>
  <li class="number">That I yet know not?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FRI. L.">
  <li class="number">Too familiar</li>
  <li class="number">Is my dear son with such sour company!</li>
  <li class="number">I bring thee tidings of the Prince’s doom.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROM.">
  <li class="number">What less than dooms-day is the Prince’s doom?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FRI. L.">
  <li class="number">A gentler judgment vanish’d from his lips—</li>
  <li class="number">Not body’s death, but body’s banishment.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROM.">
  <li class="number">Ha, banishment? Be merciful, say “death”;</li>
  <li class="number">For exile hath more terror in his look,</li>
  <li class="number">Much more than death. Do not say “banishment”!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FRI. L.">
  <li class="number">Here from Verona art thou banished.</li>
  <li class="number">Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROM.">
  <li class="number">There is no world without Verona walls,</li>
  <li class="number">But purgatory, torture, hell itself.</li>
  <li class="number">Hence “banished” is banish’d from the world,</li>
  <li class="number">And world’s exile is death; then “banished”</li>
  <li class="number">Is death misterm’d. Calling death “banished,”</li>
  <li class="number">Thou cut’st my head off with a golden axe,</li>
  <li class="number">And smilest upon the stroke that murders me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FRI. L.">
  <li class="number">O deadly sin! O rude unthankfulness!</li>
  <li class="number">Thy fault our law calls death, but the kind Prince,</li>
  <li class="number">Taking thy part, hath rush’d aside the law,</li>
  <li class="number">And turn’d that black word ’death’ to “banishment.”</li>
  <li class="number">This is dear mercy, and thou seest it not.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROM.">
  <li class="number">’Tis torture, and not mercy. Heaven is here</li>
  <li class="number">Where Juliet lives, and every cat and dog</li>
  <li class="number">And little mouse, every unworthy thing,</li>
  <li class="number">Live here in heaven and may look on her,</li>
  <li class="number">But Romeo may not. More validity,</li>
  <li class="number">More honorable state, more courtship lives</li>
  <li class="number">In carrion flies than Romeo; they may seize</li>
  <li class="number">On the white wonder of dear Juliet’s hand,</li>
  <li class="number">And steal immortal blessing from her lips,</li>
  <li class="number">Who, even in pure and vestal modesty,</li>
  <li class="number">Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;</li>
  <li class="number">But Romeo may not, he is banished.</li>
  <li class="number">Flies may do this, but I from this must fly;</li>
  <li class="number">They are free men, but I am banished:</li>
  <li class="number">And sayest thou yet that exile is not death?</li>
  <li class="number">Hadst thou no poison mix’d, no sharp-ground knife,</li>
  <li class="number">No sudden mean of death, though ne’er so mean,</li>
  <li class="number">But “banished” to kill me? “Banished”?</li>
  <li class="number">O friar, the damned use that word in hell;</li>
  <li class="number">Howling attends it. How hast thou the heart,</li>
  <li class="number">Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,</li>
  <li class="number">A sin-absolver, and my friend profess’d,</li>
  <li class="number">To mangle me with that word “banished”?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FRI. L.">
  <li class="number">Thou fond mad man, hear me a little speak.</li>

  <li class="number">To comfort thee though thou art banished.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROM.">
  <li class="number">Yet “banished”? Hang up philosophy!</li>
  <li class="number">Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,</li>
  <li class="number">Displant a town, reverse a prince’s doom,</li>
  <li class="number">It helps not, it prevails not. Talk no more.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FRI. L.">

  <li class="number">An hour but married, Tybalt murdered,</li>
  <li class="number">Doting like me, and like me banished,</li>
  <li class="number">Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair,</li>

<ol data-speaker="FRI. L.">
  <li class="number">I will be brief, for my short date of breath</li>
  <li class="number">Is not so long as is a tedious tale.</li>
  <li class="number">Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet,</li>
  <li class="number">And she, there dead, that Romeo’s faithful wife.</li>
  <li class="number">I married them, and their stol’n marriage-day</li>
  <li class="number">Was Tybalt’s dooms-day, whose untimely death</li>
  <li class="number">Banish’d the new-made bridegroom from this city,</li>
  <li class="number">For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pin’d.</li>
  <li class="number">You, to remove that siege of grief from her,</li>
  <li class="number">Betroth’d and would have married her perforce</li>
  <li class="number">To County Paris. Then comes she to me,</li>
  <li class="number">And with wild looks bid me devise some mean</li>
  <li class="number">To rid her from this second marriage,</li>
  <li class="number">Or in my cell there would she kill herself.</li>
  <li class="number">Then gave I her (so tutor’d by my art)</li>
  <li class="number">A sleeping potion, which so took effect</li>
  <li class="number">As I intended, for it wrought on her</li>
  <li class="number">The form of death. Mean time I writ to Romeo,</li>
  <li class="number">That he should hither come as this dire night</li>
  <li class="number">To help to take her from her borrowed grave,</li>
  <li class="number">Being the time the potion’s force should cease.</li>
  <li class="number">But he which bore my letter, Friar John,</li>
  <li class="number">Was stayed by accident, and yesternight</li>
  <li class="number">Return’d my letter back. Then all alone,</li>
  <li class="number">At the prefixed hour of her waking,</li>
  <li class="number">Came I to take her from her kindred’s vault,</li>
  <li class="number">Meaning to keep her closely at my cell,</li>
  <li class="number">Till I conveniently could send to Romeo.</li>
  <li class="number">But when I came, some minute ere the time</li>
  <li class="number">Of her awakening, here untimely lay</li>
  <li class="number">The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.</li>
  <li class="number">She wakes, and I entreated her come forth</li>
  <li class="number">And bear this work of heaven with patience.</li>
  <li class="number">But then a noise did scare me from the tomb,</li>
  <li class="number">And she, too desperate, would not go with me,</li>
  <li class="number">But as it seems, did violence on herself.</li>
  <li class="number">All this I know, and to the marriage</li>
  <li class="number">Her nurse is privy; and if aught in this</li>
  <li class="number">Miscarried by my fault, let my old life</li>
  <li class="number">Be sacrific’d some hour before his time,</li>
  <li class="number">Unto the rigor of severest law.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRIN.">
  <li class="number">We still have known thee for a holy man.</li>
  <li class="number">Where’s Romeo’s man? What can he say to this?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BAL.">
  <li class="number">I brought my master news of Juliet’s death,</li>
  <li class="number">And then in post he came from Mantua</li>
  <li class="number">To this same place, to this same monument.</li>
  <li class="number">This letter he early bid me give his father,</li>
  <li class="number">And threat’ned me with death, going in the vault,</li>
  <li class="number">If I departed not and left him there.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRIN.">
  <li class="number">Give me the letter, I will look on it.</li>

  <li class="number">Sirrah, what made your master in this place?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PAGE.">
  <li class="number">He came with flowers to strew his lady’s grave,</li>
  <li class="number">And bid me stand aloof, and so I did.</li>
  <li class="number">Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb,</li>
  <li class="number">And by and by my master drew on him,</li>
  <li class="number">And then I ran away to call the watch.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PRIN.">
  <li class="number">This letter doth make good the friar’s words,</li>
  <li class="number">Their course of love, the tidings of her death;</li>
  <li class="number">And here he writes that he did buy a poison</li>
  <li class="number">Of a poor pothecary, and therewithal</li>
  <li class="number">Came to this vault, to die and lie with Juliet.</li>
  <li class="number">Where be these enemies? Capulet! Montague!</li>
  <li class="number">See what a scourge is laid upon your hate,</li>
  <li class="number">That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love.</li>
  <li class="number">And I for winking at your discords too</li>
  <li class="number">Have lost a brace of kinsmen. All are punish’d.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAP.">
  <li class="number">O brother Montague, give me thy hand.</li>
  <li class="number">This is my daughter’s jointure, for no more</li>
  <li class="number">Can I demand.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MON.">
  <li class="number">But I can give thee more,</li>

  <li class="number">That whiles Verona by that name is known,</li>
  <li class="number">There shall no figure at such rate be set</li>
  <li class="number">As that of true and faithful Juliet.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAP.">
  <li class="number">As rich shall Romeo’s by his lady’s lie,</li>
  <li class="number">Poor sacrifices of our enmity!</li>

<ol data-speaker="PRIN.">
  <li class="number">A glooming peace this morning with it brings,</li>

  <li class="number">Go hence to have more talk of these sad things;</li>
  <li class="number">Some shall be pardon’d, and some punished:</li>
