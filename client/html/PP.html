<h1>The Passionate Pilgrim</h1>

  <ol>
    <li>When my love swears that she is made of truth,</li>
    <li>I do believe her (though I know she lies)</li>
    <li>That she might think me some untutor’d youth,</li>
    <li>Unskillful in the world’s false forgeries.</li>
    <li class="number">Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young,</li>
    <li>Although I know my years be past the best,</li>
    <li>I smiling credit her false-speaking tongue,</li>
    <li>Outfacing faults in love with love’s ill rest.</li>
    <li>But wherefore says my love that she is young?</li>
    <li class="number">And wherefore say not I that I am old?</li>
    <li>O, love’s best habit’s in a soothing tongue,</li>
    <li>And age in love, loves not to have years told.</li>
    <li>Therefore I’ll lie with love, and love with me,</li>
    <li>Since that our faults in love thus smother’d be.</li>
    <li class="number">Two loves I have, of comfort and despair,</li>
    <li>That like two spirits do suggest me still:</li>
    <li>My better angel is a man (right fair),</li>
    <li>My worser spirit a woman (color’d ill).</li>
    <li>To win me soon to hell, my female evil</li>
    <li class="number">Tempteth my better angel from my side;</li>
    <li>And would corrupt my saint to be a devil,</li>
    <li>Wooing his purity with her fair pride.</li>
    <li>And whether that my angel be turn’d fiend,</li>
    <li>Suspect I may (yet not directly tell):</li>
    <li class="number">For being both to me, both to each friend,</li>
    <li>I guess one angel in another’s hell:</li>
    <li>The truth I shall not know, but live in doubt,</li>
    <li>Till my bad angel fire my good one out.</li>
    <li>Did not the heavenly rhetoric of thine eye,</li>
    <li class="number">’Gainst whom the world could not hold argument,</li>
    <li>Persuade my heart to this false perjury?</li>
    <li>Vows for thee broke deserve not punishment.</li>
    <li>A woman I forswore; but I will prove,</li>
    <li>Thou being a goddess, I forswore not thee:</li>
    <li class="number">My vow was earthly, thou a heavenly love;</li>
    <li>Thy grace being gain’d cures all disgrace in me.</li>
    <li>My vow was breath, and breath a vapor is,</li>
    <li>Then thou, fair sun, that on this earth doth shine,</li>
    <li>Exhal’st this vapor vow, in thee it is:</li>
    <li class="number">If broken, then it is no fault of mine.</li>
    <li>If by me broke, what fool is not so wise</li>
    <li>To break an oath, to win a paradise?</li>
    <li>Sweet Cytherea, sitting by a brook</li>
    <li>With young Adonis, lovely, fresh, and green,</li>
    <li class="number">Did court the lad with many a lovely look,</li>
    <li>Such looks as none could look but beauty’s queen.</li>
    <li>She told him stories to delight his ear;</li>
    <li>She show’d him favors to allure his eye;</li>
    <li>To win his heart she touch’d him here and thereâ€”</li>
    <li class="number">Touches so soft still conquer chastity.</li>
    <li>But whether unripe years did want conceit,</li>
    <li>Or he refus’d to take her figured proffer,</li>
    <li>The tender nibbler would not touch the bait,</li>
    <li>But smile and jest at every gentle offer.</li>
    <li class="number">Then fell she on her back, fair queen, and toward:</li>
    <li>He rose and ran away, ah, fool too froward!</li>
    <li>If love make me forsworn, how shall I swear to love?</li>
    <li>O, never faith could hold, if not to beauty vowed:</li>
    <li>Though to myself forsworn, to thee I’ll constant prove;</li>
    <li class="number">Those thoughts to me like oaks, to thee like osiers bowed.</li>
    <li>Study his bias leaves, and makes his book thine eyes,</li>
    <li>Where all those pleasures live that art can comprehend.</li>
    <li>If knowledge be the mark, to know thee shall suffice:</li>
    <li>Well learned is that tongue that well can thee commend,</li>
    <li class="number">All ignorant that soul that sees thee without wonder,</li>
    <li>Which is to me some praise, that I thy parts admire.</li>
    <li>Thine eye Jove’s lightning seems, thy voice his dreadful thunder,</li>
    <li>Which, not to anger bent, is music and sweet fire.</li>
    <li>Celestial as thou art, O, do not love that wrong:</li>
    <li class="number">To sing heaven’s praise with such an earthly tongue.</li>
    <li>Scarce had the sun dried up the dewy morn,</li>
    <li>And scarce the herd gone to the hedge for shade,</li>
    <li>When Cytherea (all in love forlorn)</li>
    <li>A longing tarriance for Adonis made</li>
    <li class="number">Under an osier growing by a brook,</li>
    <li>A brook where Adon us’d to cool his spleen.</li>
    <li>Hot was the day, she hotter that did look</li>
    <li>For his approach, that often there had been.</li>
    <li>Anon he comes, and throws his mantle by,</li>
    <li class="number">And stood stark naked on the brook’s green brim.</li>
    <li>The sun look’d on the world with glorious eye,</li>
    <li>Yet not so wistly as this queen on him.</li>
    <li>He spying her, bounc’d in, whereas he stood;</li>
    <li>“O Jove,” quoth she, “why was not I a flood?”</li>
    <li class="number">Fair is my love, but not so fair as fickle,</li>
    <li>Mild as a dove, but neither true nor trusty,</li>
    <li>Brighter than glass, and yet as glass is brittle,</li>
    <li>Softer than wax, and yet as iron rusty:</li>
    <li>A lily pale, with damask dye to grace her,</li>
    <li class="number">None fairer, nor none falser to deface her.</li>
    <li>Her lips to mine how often hath she joined,</li>
    <li>Between each kiss her oaths of true love swearing!</li>
    <li>How many tales to please me hath she coined,</li>
    <li>Dreading my love, the loss whereof still fearing!</li>
    <li class="number">Yet in the midst of all her pure protestings,</li>
    <li>Her faith, her oaths, her tears, and all were jestings.</li>
    <li>She burnt with love, as straw with fire flameth,</li>
    <li>She burnt out love, as soon as straw out-burneth;</li>
    <li>She fram’d the love, and yet she foil’d the framing,</li>
    <li class="number">She bade love last, and yet she fell a-turning.</li>
    <li>Was this a lover, or a lecher whether?</li>
    <li>Bad in the best, though excellent in neither.</li>
    <li>If music and sweet poetry agree,</li>
    <li>As they must needs (the sister and the brother),</li>
    <li class="number">Then must the love be great ’twixt thee and me,</li>
    <li>Because thou lov’st the one, and I the other.</li>
    <li>Dowland to thee is dear, whose heavenly touch</li>
    <li>Upon the lute doth ravish human sense;</li>
    <li>Spenser to me, whose deep conceit is such</li>
    <li class="number">As passing all conceit, needs no defense.</li>
    <li>Thou lov’st to hear the sweet melodious sound</li>
    <li>That Phoebus’ lute, the queen of music, makes;</li>
    <li>And I in deep delight am chiefly drown’d</li>
    <li>When as himself to singing he betakes.</li>
    <li class="number">One god is god of both (as poets feign),</li>
    <li>One knight loves both, and both in thee remain.</li>
    <li>Fair was the morn when the fair queen of love,</li>
    <li>[. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ]</li>
    <li>Paler for sorrow than her milk-white dove,</li>
    <li class="number">For Adon’s sake, a youngster proud and wild,</li>
    <li>Her stand she takes upon a steep-up hill.</li>
    <li>Anon Adonis comes with horn and hounds;</li>
    <li>She, silly queen, with more than love’s good will,</li>
    <li>Forbade the boy he should not pass those grounds.</li>
    <li class="number">“Once,” quoth she, “did I see a fair sweet youth</li>
    <li>Here in these brakes deep-wounded with a boar,</li>
    <li>Deep in the thigh, a spectacle of ruth!</li>
    <li>See, in my thigh,” quoth she, “here was the sore.”</li>
    <li>She showed hers, he saw more wounds than one,</li>
    <li class="number">And blushing fled, and left her all alone.</li>
    <li>Sweet rose, fair flower, untimely pluck’d, soon vaded,</li>
    <li>Pluck’d in the bud, and vaded in the spring!</li>
    <li>Bright orient pearl, alack, too timely shaded!</li>
    <li>Fair creature, kill’d too soon by death’s sharp sting!</li>
    <li class="number">Like a green plum that hangs upon a tree,</li>
    <li>And falls (through wind) before the fall should be.</li>
    <li>I weep for thee, and yet no cause I have,</li>
    <li>For why: thou lefts me nothing in thy will;</li>
    <li>And yet thou lefts me more than I did crave,</li>
    <li class="number">For why: I craved nothing of thee still.</li>
    <li>O yes, dear friend, I pardon crave of thee,</li>
    <li>Thy discontent thou didst bequeath to me.</li>
    <li>Venus, with Adonis sitting by her,</li>
    <li>Under a myrtle shade began to woo him.</li>
    <li class="number">She told the youngling how god Mars did try her,</li>
    <li>And as he fell to her, she fell to him.</li>
    <li>“Even thus,” quoth she, “the warlike god embrac’d me,”</li>
    <li>And then she clipt Adonis in her arms;</li>
    <li>“Even thus,” quoth she, “the warlike god unlac’d me,”</li>
    <li class="number">As if the boy should use like loving charms;</li>
    <li>“Even thus,” quoth she, “he seized on my lips,”</li>
    <li>And with her lips on his did act the seizure:</li>
    <li>And as she fetched breath, away he skips,</li>
    <li>And would not take her meaning nor her pleasure.</li>
    <li class="number">Ah, that I had my lady at this bay:</li>
    <li>To kiss and clip me till I run away!</li>
    <li>Crabbed age and youth cannot live together:</li>
    <li>Youth is full of pleasance, age is full of care,</li>
    <li>Youth like summer morn, age like winter weather,</li>
    <li class="number">Youth like summer brave, age like winter bare.</li>
    <li>Youth is full of sport, age’s breath is short,</li>
    <li>Youth is nimble, age is lame,</li>
    <li>Youth is hot and bold, age is weak and cold,</li>
    <li>Youth is wild, and age is tame.</li>
    <li class="number">Age, I do abhor thee, youth, I do adore thee:</li>
    <li>O, my love, my love is young!</li>
    <li>Age, I do defy thee. O sweet shepherd, hie thee,</li>
    <li>For methinks thou stays too long.</li>
    <li>Beauty is but a vain and doubtful good,</li>
    <li class="number">A shining gloss that vadeth suddenly,</li>
    <li>A flower that dies when first it gins to bud,</li>
    <li>A brittle glass that’s broken presently:</li>
    <li>A doubtful good, a gloss, a glass, a flower,</li>
    <li>Lost, vaded, broken, dead within an hour.</li>
    <li class="number">And as goods lost are seld or never found,</li>
    <li>As vaded gloss no rubbing will refresh,</li>
    <li>As flowers dead lie withered on the ground,</li>
    <li>As broken glass no cement can redress:</li>
    <li>So beauty blemish’d once, forever lost,</li>
    <li class="number">In spite of physic, painting, pain, and cost.</li>
    <li>Good night, good rest, ah, neither be my share!</li>
    <li>She bade good night that kept my rest away,</li>
    <li>And daff’d me to a cabin hang’d with care,</li>
    <li>To descant on the doubts of my decay.</li>
    <li class="number">“Farewell,” quoth she, “and come again tomorrow.”</li>
    <li>Fare well I could not, for I supp’d with sorrow.</li>
    <li>Yet at my parting sweetly did she smile,</li>
    <li>In scorn or friendship, nill I conster whether.</li>
    <li>’T may be she joy’d to jest at my exile,</li>
    <li class="number">’T may be again, to make me wander thither:</li>
    <li>“Wander,” a word for shadows like myself,</li>
    <li>As take the pain but cannot pluck the pelf.</li>
    <li>Lord, how mine eyes throw gazes to the east!</li>
    <li>My heart doth charge the watch; the morning rise</li>
    <li class="number">Doth cite each moving sense from idle rest,</li>
    <li>Not daring trust the office of mine eyes.</li>
    <li>While Philomela sits and sings, I sit and mark,</li>
    <li>And wish her lays were tuned like the lark.</li>
    <li>For she doth welcome daylight with her ditty,</li>
    <li class="number">And drives away dark dreaming night.</li>
    <li>The night so pack’d, I post unto my pretty;</li>
    <li>Heart hath his hope, and eyes their wished sight:</li>
    <li>Sorrow chang’d to solace, and solace mix’d with sorrow;</li>
    <li>For why, she sight, and bade me come tomorrow.</li>
    <li class="number">Were I with her, the night would post too soon,</li>
    <li>But now are minutes added to the hours;</li>
    <li>To spite me now, each minute seems a moon,</li>
    <li>Yet not for me, shine sun to succor flowers!</li>
    <li>Pack night, peep day; good day, of night now borrow:</li>
    <li class="number">Short night tonight, and length thyself tomorrow.</li>
    <li>It was a lording’s daughter, the fairest one of three,</li>
    <li>That liked of her master, as well as well might be,</li>
    <li>Till looking on an Englishman, the fairest that eye could see,</li>
    <li>Her fancy fell a-turning.</li>
    <li class="number">Long was the combat doubtful, that love with love did fight,</li>
    <li>To leave the master loveless, or kill the gallant knight:</li>
    <li>To put in practice either, alas, it was a spite</li>
    <li>Unto the silly damsel!</li>
    <li>But one must be refused; more mickle was the pain,</li>
    <li class="number">That nothing could be used, to turn them both to gain,</li>
    <li>For of the two the trusty knight was wounded with disdain:</li>
    <li>Alas, she could not help it!</li>
    <li>Thus art with arms contending was victor of the day,</li>
    <li>Which by a gift of learning did bear the maid away:</li>
    <li class="number">Then lullaby, the learned man hath got the lady gay,</li>
    <li>For now my song is ended.</li>
    <li>On a day (alack the day!)</li>
    <li>Love, whose month was ever May,</li>
    <li>Spied a blossom passing fair,</li>
    <li class="number">Playing in the wanton air.</li>
    <li>Through the velvet leaves the wind</li>
    <li>All unseen gan passage find,</li>
    <li>That the lover, sick to death,</li>
    <li>Wish’d himself the heavens’ breath.</li>
    <li class="number">“Air,” quoth he, “thy cheeks may blow,</li>
    <li>Air, would I might triumph so!</li>
    <li>But (alas) my hand hath sworn</li>
    <li>Ne’er to pluck thee from thy thorn,</li>
    <li>Vow (alack) for youth unmeet,</li>
    <li class="number">Youth, so apt to pluck a sweet.</li>
    <li>Thou for whom Jove would swear</li>
    <li>Juno but an Ethiope were,</li>
    <li>And deny himself for Jove,</li>
    <li>Turning mortal for thy love.”</li>
    <li class="number">My flocks feed not, my ewes breed not,</li>
    <li>My rams speed not, all is amiss;</li>
    <li>Love is dying, faith’s defying,</li>
    <li>Heart’s denying, causer of this.</li>
    <li>All my merry jigs are quite forgot,</li>
    <li class="number">All my lady’s love is lost, God wot.</li>
    <li>Where her faith was firmly fix’d in love,</li>
    <li>There a nay is plac’d without remove.</li>
    <li>One silly cross wrought all my loss,</li>
    <li>O frowning Fortune, cursed, fickle dame!</li>
    <li class="number">For now I see inconstancy</li>
    <li>More in women than in men remain.</li>
    <li>In black mourn I, all fears scorn I,</li>
    <li>Love hath forlorn me, living in thrall;</li>
    <li>Heart is bleeding, all help needing,</li>
    <li class="number">O cruel speeding, fraughted with gall.</li>
    <li>My shepherd’s pipe can sound no deal,</li>
    <li>My wether’s bell rings doleful knell,</li>
    <li>My curtal dog, that wont to have play’d,</li>
    <li>Plays not at all, but seems afraid;</li>
    <li class="number">With sighs so deep procures to weep,</li>
    <li>In howling wise, to see my doleful plight.</li>
    <li>How sighs resound through heartless ground,</li>
    <li>Like a thousand vanquish’d men in bloody fight!</li>
    <li>Clear wells spring not, sweet birds sing not,</li>
    <li class="number">Green plants bring not forth their dye;</li>
    <li>Herds stands weeping, flocks all sleeping,</li>
    <li>Nymphs back peeping fearfully.</li>
    <li>All our pleasure known to us poor swains,</li>
    <li>All our merry meetings on the plains,</li>
    <li class="number">All our evening sport from us is fled,</li>
    <li>All our love is lost, for Love is dead.</li>
    <li>Farewell, sweet lass, thy like ne’er was</li>
    <li>For a sweet content, the cause of all my moan.</li>
    <li>Poor Corydon must live alone,</li>
    <li class="number">Other help for him I see that there is none.</li>
    <li>When as thine eye hath chose the dame,</li>
    <li>And stall’d the deer that thou shouldst strike,</li>
    <li>Let reason rule things worthy blame,</li>
    <li>As well as fancy, partial might.</li>
    <li class="number">Take counsel of some wiser head,</li>
    <li>Neither too young nor yet unwed.</li>
    <li>And when thou com’st thy tale to tell,</li>
    <li>Smooth not thy tongue with filed talk,</li>
    <li>Lest she some subtile practice smellâ€”</li>
    <li class="number">A cripple soon can find a haltâ€”</li>
    <li>But plainly say thou lov’st her well,</li>
    <li>And set her person forth to sale.</li>
    <li>And to her will frame all thy ways,</li>
    <li>Spare not to spend, and chiefly there</li>
    <li class="number">Where thy desert may merit praise,</li>
    <li>By ringing in thy lady’s ear.</li>
    <li>The strongest castle, tower, and town,</li>
    <li>The golden bullet beats it down.</li>
    <li>Serve always with assured trust,</li>
    <li class="number">And in thy suit be humble true;</li>
    <li>Unless thy lady prove unjust,</li>
    <li>Press never thou to choose anew.</li>
    <li>When time shall serve, be thou not slack</li>
    <li>To proffer, though she put thee back.</li>
    <li class="number">What though her frowning brows be bent,</li>
    <li>Her cloudy looks will calm yer night,</li>
    <li>And then too late she will repent,</li>
    <li>That thus dissembled her delight;</li>
    <li>And twice desire, yer it be day,</li>
    <li class="number">That which with scorn she put away.</li>
    <li>What though she strive to try her strength,</li>
    <li>And ban and brawl, and say thee nay,</li>
    <li>Her feeble force will yield at length,</li>
    <li>When craft hath taught her thus to say:</li>
    <li class="number">“Had women been so strong as men,</li>
    <li>In faith, you had not had it then.”</li>
    <li>The wiles and guiles that women work,</li>
    <li>Dissembled with an outward show,</li>
    <li>The tricks and toys that in them lurk,</li>
    <li class="number">The cock that treads them shall not know.</li>
    <li>Have you not heard it said full oft,</li>
    <li>A woman’s nay doth stand for nought?</li>
    <li>Think women still to strive with men,</li>
    <li>To sin and never for to saint:</li>
    <li class="number">There is no heaven, be holy then,</li>
    <li>When time with age shall them attaint.</li>
    <li>Were kisses all the joys in bed,</li>
    <li>One woman would another wed.</li>
    <li>But soft, enoughâ€”too much, I fearâ€”</li>
    <li class="number">Lest that my mistress hear my song;</li>
    <li>She will not stick to round me on th’ ear,</li>
    <li>To teach my tongue to be so long.</li>
    <li>Yet will she blush, here be it said,</li>
    <li>To hear her secrets so bewray’d.</li>
    <li class="number">Live with me and be my love,</li>
    <li>And we will all the pleasures prove</li>
    <li>That hills and valleys, dales and fields,</li>
    <li>And all the craggy mountains yield.</li>
    <li>There will we sit upon the rocks,</li>
    <li class="number">And see the shepherds feed their flocks,</li>
    <li>By shallow rivers, by whose falls</li>
    <li>Melodious birds sing madrigals.</li>
    <li>There will I make thee a bed of roses,</li>
    <li>With a thousand fragrant posies,</li>
    <li class="number">A cap of flowers, and a kirtle</li>
    <li>Embroidered all with leaves of myrtle;</li>
    <li>A belt of straw and ivy buds,</li>
    <li>With coral clasps and amber studs:</li>
    <li>And if these pleasures may thee move,</li>
    <li class="number">Then live with me, and be my love.</li>
    <li>If that the world and love were young,</li>
    <li>And truth in every shepherd’s tongue,</li>
    <li>These pretty pleasures might me move,</li>
    <li>To live with thee and be thy love.</li>
    <li class="number">As it fell upon a day,</li>
    <li>In the merry month of May,</li>
    <li>Sitting in a pleasant shade,</li>
    <li>Which a grove of myrtles made,</li>
    <li>Beasts did leap and birds did sing,</li>
    <li class="number">Trees did grow and plants did spring;</li>
    <li>Every thing did banish moan,</li>
    <li>Save the nightingale alone.</li>
    <li>She, poor bird, as all forlorn,</li>
    <li>Lean’d her breast up-till a thorn,</li>
    <li class="number">And there sung the dolefull’st ditty,</li>
    <li>That to hear it was great pity.</li>
    <li>“Fie, fie, fie,” now would she cry,</li>
    <li>“Tereu, tereu,” by and by;</li>
    <li>That to hear her so complain,</li>
    <li class="number">Scarce I could from tears refrain;</li>
    <li>For her griefs, so lively shown,</li>
    <li>Made me think upon mine own.</li>
    <li>Ah, thought I, thou mourn’st in vain,</li>
    <li>None takes pity on thy pain.</li>
    <li class="number">Senseless trees, they cannot hear thee,</li>
    <li>Ruthless bears, they will not cheer thee.</li>
    <li>King Pandion, he is dead:</li>
    <li>All thy friends are lapp’d in lead;</li>
    <li>All thy fellow birds do sing,</li>
    <li class="number">Careless of thy sorrowing.</li>
    <li>Whilst as fickle Fortune smil’d,</li>
    <li>Thou and I were both beguil’d.</li>
    <li>Every one that flatters thee</li>
    <li>Is no friend in misery.</li>
    <li class="number">Words are easy, like the wind,</li>
    <li>Faithful friends are hard to find:</li>
    <li>Every man will be thy friend,</li>
    <li>Whilst thou hast wherewith to spend;</li>
    <li>But if store of crowns be scant,</li>
    <li class="number">No man will supply thy want.</li>
    <li>If that one be prodigal,</li>
    <li>Bountiful they will him call;</li>
    <li>And with such-like flattering,</li>
    <li>“Pity but he were a king!”</li>
    <li class="number">If he be addict to vice,</li>
    <li>Quickly him they will entice;</li>
    <li>If to women he be bent,</li>
    <li>They have at commandment.</li>
    <li>But if Fortune once do frown,</li>
    <li class="number">Then farewell his great renown;</li>
    <li>They that fawn’d on him before</li>
    <li>Use his company no more.</li>
    <li>He that is thy friend indeed,</li>
    <li>He will help thee in thy need:</li>
    <li class="number">If thou sorrow, he will weep;</li>
    <li>If thou wake, he cannot sleep;</li>
    <li>Thus of every grief in heart</li>
    <li>He with thee doth bear a part.</li>
    <li>These are certain signs to know</li>
    <li class="number">Faithful friend from flatt’ring foe.</li>
