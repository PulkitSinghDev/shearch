  <li class="number">If you shall chance, Camillo, to visit Bohemia on the like occasion whereon my services are now on foot, you shall see (as I have said) great difference betwixt our Bohemia and your Sicilia.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAM.">
  <li class="number">I think, this coming summer, the King of Sicilia means to pay Bohemia the visitation which he justly owes him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ARCH.">
  <li class="number">Wherein our entertainment shall shame us: we will be justified in our loves; for indeed—</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAM.">
  <li class="number">Beseech you—</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ARCH.">
  <li class="number">Verily, I speak it in the freedom of my knowledge: we cannot with such magnificence—in so rare—I know not what to say—We will give you sleepy drinks, that your senses (unintelligent of our insufficience) may, though they cannot praise us, as little accuse us.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAM.">
  <li class="number">You pay a great deal too dear for what’s given freely.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ARCH.">
  <li class="number">Believe me, I speak as my understanding instructs me, and as mine honesty puts it to utterance.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAM.">
  <li class="number">Sicilia cannot show himself overkind to Bohemia. They were train’d together in their childhoods; and there rooted betwixt them then such an affection, which cannot choose but branch now. Since their more mature dignities and royal necessities made separation of their society, their encounters (though not personal) hath been royally attorney’d with interchange of gifts, letters, loving embassies, that they have seem’d to be together, though absent; shook hands, as over a vast; and embrac’d as it were from the ends of oppos’d winds. The heavens continue their loves!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ARCH.">
  <li class="number">I think there is not in the world either malice or matter to alter it. You have an unspeakable comfort of your young prince Mamillius: it is a gentleman of the greatest promise that ever came into my note.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAM.">
  <li class="number">I very well agree with you in the hopes of him; it is a gallant child; one that, indeed, physics the subject, makes old hearts fresh. They that went on crutches ere he was born desire yet their life to see him a man.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ARCH.">
  <li class="number">Would they else be content to die?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAM.">
  <li class="number">Yes; if there were no other excuse why they should desire to live.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ARCH.">
  <li class="number">If the King had no son, they would desire to live on crutches till he had one.</li>

  <li class="number">Nine changes of the wat’ry star hath been</li>
  <li class="number">The shepherd’s note since we have left our throne</li>
  <li class="number">Without a burden. Time as long again</li>
  <li class="number">Would be fill’d up, my brother, with our thanks,</li>
  <li class="number">And yet we should, for perpetuity,</li>
  <li class="number">Go hence in debt. And therefore, like a cipher</li>
  <li class="number">(Yet standing in rich place), I multiply</li>
  <li class="number">With one “We thank you” many thousands more</li>
  <li class="number">That go before it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEON.">
  <li class="number">Stay your thanks a while,</li>
  <li class="number">And pay them when you part.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POL.">
  <li class="number">Sir, that’s tomorrow.</li>
  <li class="number">I am question’d by my fears of what may chance</li>
  <li class="number">Or breed upon our absence, that may blow</li>
  <li class="number">No sneaping winds at home, to make us say,</li>
  <li class="number">“This is put forth too truly.” Besides, I have stay’d</li>
  <li class="number">To tire your royalty.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEON.">
  <li class="number">We are tougher, brother,</li>
  <li class="number">Than you can put us to’t.</li>

<ol data-speaker="POL.">
  <li class="number">No longer stay.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEON.">
  <li class="number">One sev’nnight longer.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POL.">
  <li class="number">Very sooth, tomorrow.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEON.">
  <li class="number">We’ll part the time between ’s then; and in that</li>
  <li class="number">I’ll no gainsaying.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POL.">
  <li class="number">Press me not, beseech you, so.</li>
  <li class="number">There is no tongue that moves, none, none i’ th’ world,</li>
  <li class="number">So soon as yours could win me. So it should now,</li>
  <li class="number">Were there necessity in your request, although</li>
  <li class="number">’Twere needful I denied it. My affairs</li>
  <li class="number">Do even drag me homeward; which to hinder</li>
  <li class="number">Were (in your love) a whip to me; my stay,</li>
  <li class="number">To you a charge and trouble. To save both,</li>
  <li class="number">Farewell, our brother.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEON.">
  <li class="number">Tongue-tied our queen? Speak you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HER.">
  <li class="number">I had thought, sir, to have held my peace until</li>
  <li class="number">You had drawn oaths from him not to stay. You, sir,</li>
  <li class="number">Charge him too coldly. Tell him you are sure</li>
  <li class="number">All in Bohemia’s well; this satisfaction</li>
  <li class="number">The by-gone day proclaim’d. Say this to him,</li>
  <li class="number">He’s beat from his best ward.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEON.">
  <li class="number">Well said, Hermione.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HER.">
  <li class="number">To tell he longs to see his son were strong;</li>
  <li class="number">But let him say so then, and let him go;</li>
  <li class="number">But let him swear so, and he shall not stay,</li>
  <li class="number">We’ll thwack him hence with distaffs.</li>
  <li class="number">Yet of your royal presence I’ll adventure</li>
  <li class="number">The borrow of a week. When at Bohemia</li>
  <li class="number">You take my lord, I’ll give him my commission</li>
  <li class="number">To let him there a month behind the gest</li>
  <li class="number">Prefix’d for ’s parting; yet, good deed, Leontes,</li>
  <li class="number">I love thee not a jar o’ th’ clock behind</li>
  <li class="number">What lady she her lord. You’ll stay?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POL.">
  <li class="number">No, madam.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HER.">
  <li class="number">Nay, but you will?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POL.">
  <li class="number">I may not, verily.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HER.">
  <li class="number">Verily?</li>
  <li class="number">You put me off with limber vows; but I,</li>
  <li class="number">Though you would seek t’ unsphere the stars with oaths,</li>
  <li class="number">Should yet say, “Sir, no going.” Verily,</li>
  <li class="number">You shall not go; a lady’s “verily” is</li>
  <li class="number">As potent as a lord’s. Will you go yet?</li>
  <li class="number">Force me to keep you as a prisoner,</li>
  <li class="number">Not like a guest: so you shall pay your fees</li>
  <li class="number">When you depart, and save your thanks. How say you?</li>
  <li class="number">My prisoner? Or my guest? By your dread “verily,”</li>
  <li class="number">One of them you shall be.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POL.">
  <li class="number">Your guest then, madam.</li>
  <li class="number">To be your prisoner should import offending,</li>
  <li class="number">Which is for me less easy to commit</li>
  <li class="number">Than you to punish.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HER.">
  <li class="number">Not your jailer then,</li>
  <li class="number">But your kind hostess. Come, I’ll question you</li>
  <li class="number">Of my lord’s tricks and yours when you were boys.</li>
  <li class="number">You were pretty lordings then?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POL.">
  <li class="number">We were, fair queen,</li>
  <li class="number">Two lads that thought there was no more behind</li>
  <li class="number">But such a day tomorrow as today,</li>
  <li class="number">And to be boy eternal.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HER.">
  <li class="number">Was not my lord</li>
  <li class="number">The verier wag o’ th’ two?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POL.">
  <li class="number">We were as twinn’d lambs that did frisk i’ th’ sun,</li>
  <li class="number">And bleat the one at th’ other. What we chang’d</li>
  <li class="number">Was innocence for innocence; we knew not</li>
  <li class="number">The doctrine of ill-doing, nor dream’d</li>
  <li class="number">That any did. Had we pursu’d that life,</li>
  <li class="number">And our weak spirits ne’er been higher rear’d</li>
  <li class="number">With stronger blood, we should have answer’d heaven</li>
  <li class="number">Boldly, “Not guilty”; the imposition clear’d,</li>
  <li class="number">Hereditary ours.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HER.">
  <li class="number">By this we gather</li>
  <li class="number">You have tripp’d since.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POL.">
  <li class="number">O my most sacred lady,</li>
  <li class="number">Temptations have since then been born to ’s: for</li>
  <li class="number">In those unfledg’d days was my wife a girl;</li>
  <li class="number">Your precious self had then not cross’d the eyes</li>
  <li class="number">Of my young playfellow.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HER.">
  <li class="number">Grace to boot!</li>
  <li class="number">Of this make no conclusion, lest you say</li>
  <li class="number">Your queen and I are devils. Yet go on,</li>
  <li class="number">Th’ offenses we have made you do we’ll answer,</li>
  <li class="number">If you first sinn’d with us, and that with us</li>
  <li class="number">You did continue fault, and that you slipp’d not</li>
  <li class="number">With any but with us.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEON.">
  <li class="number">Is he won yet?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HER.">
  <li class="number">He’ll stay, my lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEON.">
  <li class="number">At my request he would not.</li>
  <li class="number">Hermione, my dearest, thou never spok’st</li>
  <li class="number">To better purpose.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HER.">
  <li class="number">Never?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEON.">
  <li class="number">Never, but once.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HER.">
  <li class="number">What? Have I twice said well? When was’t before?</li>
  <li class="number">I prithee tell me; cram ’s with praise, and make ’s</li>
  <li class="number">As fat as tame things. One good deed dying tongueless</li>
  <li class="number">Slaughters a thousand waiting upon that.</li>
  <li class="number">Our praises are our wages. You may ride ’s</li>
  <li class="number">With one soft kiss a thousand furlongs ere</li>
  <li class="number">With spur we heat an acre. But to th’ goal:</li>
  <li class="number">My last good deed was to entreat his stay;</li>
  <li class="number">What was my first? It has an elder sister,</li>
  <li class="number">Or I mistake you. O, would her name were Grace!</li>
  <li class="number">But once before I spoke to th’ purpose? When?</li>
  <li class="number">Nay, let me have’t; I long.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEON.">
  <li class="number">Why, that was when</li>
  <li class="number">Three crabbed months had sour’d themselves to death,</li>
  <li class="number">Ere I could make thee open thy white hand,</li>
  <li class="number">And clap thyself my love; then didst thou utter,</li>
  <li class="number">“I am yours forever.”</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HER.">
  <li class="number">’Tis Grace indeed.</li>
  <li class="number">Why, lo you now! I have spoke to th’ purpose twice:</li>
  <li class="number">The one forever earn’d a royal husband;</li>
  <li class="number">Th’ other for some while a friend.</li>

  <li class="number">Too hot, too hot!</li>
  <li class="number">To mingle friendship far is mingling bloods.</li>
  <li class="number">I have <foreign xml:lang="la">tremor cordis</foreign> on me; my heart dances,</li>

  <li class="number">No, in good earnest.</li>
  <li class="number">How sometimes nature will betray its folly!</li>
  <li class="number">Its tenderness! And make itself a pastime</li>

  <li class="number">Of my boy’s face, methoughts I did recoil</li>
  <li class="number">Twenty-three years, and saw myself unbreech’d</li>
  <li class="number">In my green velvet coat, my dagger muzzled,</li>

  <li class="number">Th’ entreaties of your mistress? Satisfy?</li>
  <li class="number">Let that suffice. I have trusted thee, Camillo,</li>
  <li class="number">With all the nearest things to my heart, as well</li>
  <li class="number">My chamber-councils, wherein, priest-like, thou</li>

<ol data-speaker="CAM.">
  <li class="number">My gracious lord,</li>

  <li class="number">If ever I were willful-negligent,</li>
  <li class="number">It was my folly; if industriously</li>
  <li class="number">I play’d the fool, it was my negligence,</li>

  <li class="number">To do a thing, where I the issue doubted,</li>
  <li class="number">Whereof the execution did cry out</li>
  <li class="number">Against the non-performance, ’twas a fear</li>
  <li class="number">Which oft infects the wisest: these, my lord,</li>

  <li class="number">Is never free of. But beseech your Grace</li>
  <li class="number">Be plainer with me, let me know my trespass</li>
  <li class="number">By its own visage. If I then deny it,</li>

  <li class="number">None rare, my lord.</li>

  <li class="number">The King hath on him such a countenance</li>
  <li class="number">As he had lost some province and a region</li>
  <li class="number">Lov’d as he loves himself. Even now I met him</li>
  <li class="number">With customary compliment, when he,</li>

  <li class="number">A lip of much contempt, speeds from me, and</li>

  <li class="number">I dare not know, my lord.</li>

  <li class="number">For to yourself, what you do know, you must,</li>
  <li class="number">And cannot say you dare not. Good Camillo,</li>
  <li class="number">Your chang’d complexions are to me a mirror</li>

  <li class="number">Which honor does acknowledge, whereof the least</li>
  <li class="number">Is not this suit of mine, that thou declare</li>

  <li class="number">If not, how best to bear it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAM.">
  <li class="number">Sir, I will tell you,</li>

  <li class="number">Which must be ev’n as swiftly followed as</li>

  <li class="number">Forbiddenly.</li>

<ol data-speaker="POL.">
  <li class="number">O then, my best blood turn</li>
  <li class="number">To an infected jelly, and my name</li>
  <li class="number">Be yok’d with his that did betray the Best!</li>
  <li class="number">Turn then my freshest reputation to</li>
  <li class="number">A savor that may strike the dullest nostril</li>
  <li class="number">Where I arrive, and my approach be shunn’d,</li>
  <li class="number">Nay, hated too, worse than the great’st infection</li>
  <li class="number">That e’er was heard or read!</li>

<ol data-speaker="CAM.">
  <li class="number">Swear his thought over</li>
  <li class="number">By each particular star in heaven, and</li>

  <li class="number">As or by oath remove or counsel shake</li>
  <li class="number">The fabric of his folly, whose foundation</li>
  <li class="number">Is pil’d upon his faith, and will continue</li>
  <li class="number">The standing of his body.</li>

<ol data-speaker="POL.">
  <li class="number">How should this grow?</li>

<ol data-speaker="CAM.">
  <li class="number">I know not; but I am sure ’tis safer to</li>

  <li class="number">If therefore you dare trust my honesty,</li>
  <li class="number">That lies enclosed in this trunk which you</li>

  <li class="number">Your followers I will whisper to the business,</li>

  <li class="number">By this discovery lost. Be not uncertain,</li>
  <li class="number">For by the honor of my parents, I</li>

  <li class="number">Good expedition be my friend, and comfort</li>
  <li class="number">The gracious queen, part of his theme, but nothing</li>

<ol data-speaker="POL.">
  <li class="number">I pray thee, good Camillo, be no more importunate. ’Tis a sickness denying thee any thing; a death to grant this.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAM.">
  <li class="number">It is fifteen years since I saw my country; though I have for the most part been air’d abroad, I desire to lay my bones there. Besides, the penitent King, my master, hath sent for me, to whose feeling sorrows I might be some allay (or I o’erween to think so), which is another spur to my departure.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POL.">
  <li class="number">As thou lov’st me, Camillo, wipe not out the rest of thy services by leaving me now. The need I have of thee, thine own goodness hath made. Better not to have had thee than thus to want thee. Thou, having made me businesses which none without thee can sufficiently manage, must either stay to execute them thyself, or take away with thee the very services thou hast done; which if I have not enough consider’d (as too much I cannot), to be more thankful to thee shall be my study, and my profit therein the heaping friendships. Of that fatal country Sicilia, prithee speak no more, whose very naming punishes me with the remembrance of that penitent (as thou call’st him) and reconcil’d king, my brother, whose loss of his most precious queen and children are even now to be afresh lamented. Say to me, when saw’st thou the Prince Florizel, my son? Kings are no less unhappy, their issue not being gracious, than they are in losing them when they have approv’d their virtues.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAM.">
  <li class="number">Sir, it is three days since I saw the Prince. What his happier affairs may be, are to me unknown; but I have (missingly) noted, he is of late much retir’d from court, and is less frequent to his princely exercises than formerly he hath appear’d.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POL.">
  <li class="number">I have consider’d so much, Camillo, and with some care, so far that I have eyes under my service which look upon his removedness; from whom I have this intelligence, that he is seldom from the house of a most homely shepherd, a man, they say, that from very nothing, and beyond the imagination of his neighbors, is grown into an unspeakable estate.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAM.">
  <li class="number">I have heard, sir, of such a man, who hath a daughter of most rare note. The report of her is extended more than can be thought to begin from such a cottage.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POL.">
  <li class="number">That’s likewise part of my intelligence; but (I fear) the angle that plucks our son thither. Thou shalt accompany us to the place, where we will (not appearing what we are) have some question with the shepherd; from whose simplicity I think it not uneasy to get the cause of my son’s resort thither. Prithee be my present partner in this business, and lay aside the thoughts of Sicilia.</li>
</ol>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="AUT.">
  <li class="number">Your affairs there? What? With whom? The condition of that fardel? The place of your dwelling? Your names? Your ages? Of what having? Breeding? And any thing that is fitting to be known—discover.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLO.">
  <li class="number">We are but plain fellows, sir.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="AUT.">
  <li class="number">A lie; you are rough and hairy. Let me have no lying. It becomes none but tradesmen, and they often give us soldiers the lie, but we pay them for it with stamped coin, not stabbing steel, therefore they do not give us the lie.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLO.">
  <li class="number">Your worship had like to have given us one, if you had not taken yourself with the manner.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHEP.">
  <li class="number">Are you a courtier, and’t like you, sir?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="AUT.">
  <li class="number">Whether it like me or no, I am a courtier. Seest thou not the air of the court in these enfoldings? Hath not my gait in it the measure of the court? Receives not thy nose court-odor from me? Reflect I not on thy baseness court-contempt? Think’st thou, for that I insinuate, that toze from thee thy business, I am therefore no courtier? I am courtier cap-a-pe, and one that will either push on or pluck back thy business there; whereupon I command thee to open thy affair.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHEP.">
  <li class="number">My business, sir, is to the King.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="AUT.">
  <li class="number">What advocate hast thou to him?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHEP.">
  <li class="number">I know not, and’t like you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLO.">
  <li class="number">Advocate’s the court-word for a pheasant. Say you have none.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHEP.">
  <li class="number">None, sir; I have no pheasant cock, nor hen.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="AUT.">
  <li class="number">How blessed are we that are not simple men!</li>
  <li class="number">Yet nature might have made me as these are,</li>
  <li class="number">Therefore I will not disdain.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLO.">
  <li class="number">This cannot be but a great courtier.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHEP.">
  <li class="number">His garments are rich, but he wears them not handsomely.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLO.">
  <li class="number">He seems to be the more noble in being fantastical. A great man, I’ll warrant; I know by the picking on ’s teeth.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="AUT.">
  <li class="number">The fardel there? What’s i’ th’ fardel? Wherefore that box?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHEP.">
  <li class="number">Sir, there lies such secrets in this fardel and box, which none must know but the King, and which he shall know within this hour, if I may come to th’ speech of him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="AUT.">
  <li class="number">Age, thou hast lost thy labor.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHEP.">
  <li class="number">Why, sir?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="AUT.">
  <li class="number">The King is not at the palace. He is gone aboard a new ship to purge melancholy and air himself; for if thou be’st capable of things serious, thou must know the King is full of grief.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHEP.">
  <li class="number">So ’tis said, sir—about his son, that should have married a shepherd’s daughter.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="AUT.">
  <li class="number">If that shepherd be not in hand-fast, let him fly. The curses he shall have, the tortures he shall feel, will break the back of man, the heart of monster.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLO.">
  <li class="number">Think you so, sir?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="AUT.">
  <li class="number">Not he alone shall suffer what wit can make heavy and vengeance bitter; but those that are germane to him (though remov’d fifty times) shall all come under the hangman; which though it be great pity, yet it is necessary. An old sheep-whistling rogue, a ram-tender, to offer to have his daughter come into grace! Some say he shall be ston’d; but that death is too soft for him, say I. Draw our throne into a sheep-cote!—all deaths are too few, the sharpest too easy.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLO.">
  <li class="number">Has the old man e’er a son, sir, do you hear, and’t like you, sir?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="AUT.">
  <li class="number">He has a son, who shall be flay’d alive; then ’nointed over with honey, set on the head of a wasp’s nest; then stand till he be three quarters and a dram dead; then recover’d again with aqua-vitae or some other hot infusion; then, raw as he is (and in the hottest day prognostication proclaims), shall he be set against a brick-wall, the sun looking with a southward eye upon him, where he is to behold him with flies blown to death. But what talk we of these traitorly rascals, whose miseries are to be smil’d at, their offenses being so capital? Tell me (for you seem to be honest plain men) what you have to the King. Being something gently consider’d, I’ll bring you where he is aboard, tender your persons to his presence, whisper him in your behalfs; and if it be in man besides the King to effect your suits, here is man shall do it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLO.">
  <li class="number">He seems to be of great authority. Close with him, give him gold; and though authority be a stubborn bear, yet he is oft led by the nose with gold. Show the inside of your purse to the outside of his hand, and no more ado. Remember “ston’d,” and “flay’d alive.”</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHEP.">
  <li class="number">And’t please you, sir, to undertake the business for us, here is that gold I have. I’ll make it as much more, and leave this young man in pawn till I bring it you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="AUT.">
  <li class="number">After I have done what I promis’d?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHEP.">
  <li class="number">Ay, sir.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="AUT.">
  <li class="number">Well, give me the moi’ty. Are you a party in this business?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLO.">
  <li class="number">In some sort, sir; but though my case be a pitiful one, I hope I shall not be flay’d out of it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="AUT.">
  <li class="number">O, that’s the case of the shepherd’s son. Hang him, he’ll be made an example.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLO.">
  <li class="number">Comfort, good comfort! We must to the King, and show our strange sights. He must know ’tis none of your daughter, nor my sister; we are gone else. Sir, I will give you as much as this old man does when the business is perform’d, and remain (as he says) your pawn till it be brought you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="AUT.">
  <li class="number">I will trust you. Walk before toward the sea-side, go on the right hand, I will but look upon the hedge, and follow you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLO.">
  <li class="number">We are bless’d in this man, as I may say, even bless’d.</li>

I will bring these two moles, these blind ones, aboard him. If he think it fit to shore them again, and that the complaint they have to the King concerns him nothing, let him call me rogue for being so far officious, for I am proof against that title, and what shame else belongs to’t.

<h3>Scene 2</h3>

<h4>Sicilia. Before Leontes’ palace.</h4>

<div class="stage-direction">
	Enter Autolycus and a Gentleman.
	
		AUT.
		1. GENT.
	
</div>

<ol data-speaker="AUT.">
  <li class="number">Beseech you, sir, were you present at this relation?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. GENT.">
  <li class="number">I was by at the opening of the fardel, heard the old shepherd deliver the manner how he found it; whereupon, after a little amazedness, we were all commanded out of the chamber; only this, methought, I heard the shepherd say, he found the child.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="AUT.">
  <li class="number">I would most gladly know the issue of it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. GENT.">
  <li class="number">I make a broken delivery of the business; but the changes I perceiv’d in the King and Camillo were very notes of admiration. They seem’d almost, with staring on one another, to tear the cases of their eyes. There was speech in their dumbness, language in their very gesture; they look’d as they had heard of a world ransom’d, or one destroy’d. A notable passion of wonder appear’d in them; but the wisest beholder, that knew no more but seeing, could not say if th’ importance were joy or sorrow; but in the extremity of the one, it must needs be.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">
	Enter another Gentleman.
	
		2. GENT.
	
</li>
  <li class="number">Here comes a gentleman that haply knows more. The news, Rogero?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="2. GENT.">
  <li class="number">Nothing but bonfires. The oracle is fulfill’d; the King’s daughter is found. Such a deal of wonder is broken out within this hour that ballad-makers cannot be able to express it.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">
	Enter another Gentleman.
	
		3. GENT.
	
</li>
  <li class="number">Here comes the Lady Paulina’s steward, he can deliver you more. How goes it now, sir? This news, which is call’d true, is so like an old tale, that the verity of it is in strong suspicion. Has the King found his heir?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="3. GENT.">
  <li class="number">Most true, if ever truth were pregnant by circumstance. That which you hear you’ll swear you see, there is such unity in the proofs. The mantle of Queen Hermione’s; her jewel about the neck of it; the letters of Antigonus found with it, which they know to be his character; the majesty of the creature in resemblance of the mother; the affection of nobleness which nature shows above her breeding; and many other evidences proclaim her, with all certainty, to be the King’s daughter. Did you see the meeting of the two kings?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="2. GENT.">
  <li class="number">No.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="3. GENT.">
  <li class="number">Then have you lost a sight which was to be seen, cannot be spoken of. There might you have beheld one joy crown another, so and in such manner that it seem’d sorrow wept to take leave of them, for their joy waded in tears. There was casting up of eyes, holding up of hands, with countenance of such distraction that they were to be known by garment, not by favor. Our king, being ready to leap out of himself for joy of his found daughter, as if that joy were now become a loss, cries, “O, thy mother, thy mother!”; then asks Bohemia forgiveness; then embraces his son-in-law; then again worries he his daughter with clipping her. Now he thanks the old shepherd, which stands by like a weather-bitten conduit of many kings’ reigns. I never heard of such another encounter, which lames report to follow it, and undoes description to do it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="2. GENT.">
  <li class="number">What, pray you, became of Antigonus, that carried hence the child?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="3. GENT.">
  <li class="number">Like an old tale still, which will have matter to rehearse, though credit be asleep and not an ear open: he was torn to pieces with a bear. This avouches the shepherd’s son, who has not only his innocence (which seems much) to justify him, but a handkerchief and rings of his that Paulina knows.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. GENT.">
  <li class="number">What became of his bark and his followers?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="3. GENT.">
  <li class="number">Wrack’d the same instant of their master’s death, and in the view of the shepherd; so that all the instruments which aided to expose the child were even then lost when it was found. But O, the noble combat that ’twixt joy and sorrow was fought in Paulina! She had one eye declin’d for the loss of her husband, another elevated that the oracle was fulfill’d. She lifted the Princess from the earth, and so locks her in embracing, as if she would pin her to her heart, that she might no more be in danger of losing.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. GENT.">
  <li class="number">The dignity of this act was worth the audience of kings and princes, for by such was it acted.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="3. GENT.">
  <li class="number">One of the prettiest touches of all, and that which angled for mine eyes (caught the water though not the fish), was when, at the relation of the Queen’s death (with the manner how she came to’t bravely confess’d and lamented by the King), how attentiveness wounded his daughter, till (from one sign of dolor to another) she did (with an “Alas!”), I would fain say, bleed tears; for I am sure my heart wept blood. Who was most marble there chang’d color; some swounded, all sorrow’d. If all the world could have seen’t, the woe had been universal.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. GENT.">
  <li class="number">Are they return’d to the court?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="3. GENT.">
  <li class="number">No. The Princess hearing of her mother’s statue, which is in the keeping of Paulina—a piece many years in doing and now newly perform’d by that rare Italian master, Julio Romano, who, had he himself eternity and could put breath into his work, would beguile Nature of her custom, so perfectly he is her ape. He so near to Hermione hath done Hermione that they say one would speak to her and stand in hope of answer. Thither with all greediness of affection are they gone, and there they intend to sup.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="2. GENT.">
  <li class="number">I thought she had some great matter there in hand, for she hath privately twice or thrice a day, ever since the death of Hermione, visited that remov’d house. Shall we thither, and with our company piece the rejoicing?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. GENT.">
  <li class="number">Who would be thence that has the benefit of access? Every wink of an eye some new grace will be born. Our absence makes us unthrifty to our knowledge. Let’s along.</li>

<ol data-speaker="AUT.">
  <li class="number">Now, had I not the dash of my former life in me, would preferment drop on my head. I brought the old man and his son aboard the Prince; told him I heard them talk of a fardel, and I know not what; but he at that time, overfond of the shepherd’s daughter (so he then took her to be), who began to be much sea-sick, and himself little better, extremity of weather continuing, this mystery remain’d undiscover’d. But ’tis all one to me; for had I been the finder-out of this secret, it would not have relish’d among my other discredits.</li>

  <li class="number">Come, boy, I am past more children, but thy sons and daughters will be all gentlemen born.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLO.">
  <li class="number">You are well met, sir. You denied to fight with me this other day, because I was no gentleman born. See you these clothes?

<ol data-speaker="AUT.">
  <li class="number">I know you are now, sir, a gentleman born.</li>

<ol data-speaker="CLO.">
  <li class="number">Ay, and have been so any time these four hours.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHEP.">
  <li class="number">And so have I, boy.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLO.">
  <li class="number">So you have. But I was a gentleman born before my father; for the King’s son took me by the hand, and call’d me brother; and then the two kings call’d my father brother; and then the Prince, my brother, and the Princess, my sister, call’d my father father; and so we wept; and there was the first gentleman-like tears that ever we shed.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHEP.">
  <li class="number">We may live, son, to shed many more.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLO.">
  <li class="number">Ay; or else ’twere hard luck, being in so preposterous estate as we are.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="AUT.">
  <li class="number">I humbly beseech you, sir, to pardon me all the faults I have committed to your worship, and to give me your good report to the Prince my master.</li>

<ol data-speaker="CLO.">
  <li class="number">Give me thy hand: I will swear to the Prince thou art as honest a true fellow as any is in Bohemia.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHEP.">
  <li class="number">You may say it, but not swear it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLO.">
  <li class="number">Not swear it, now I am a gentleman? Let boors and franklins say it, I’ll swear it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHEP.">
  <li class="number">How if it be false, son?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLO.">
  <li class="number">If it be ne’er so false, a true gentleman may swear it in the behalf of his friend; and I’ll swear to the Prince thou art a tall fellow of thy hands, and that thou wilt not be drunk; but I know thou art no tall fellow of thy hands, and that thou wilt be drunk; but I’ll swear it, and I would thou wouldst be a tall fellow of thy hands.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="AUT.">
  <li class="number">I will prove so, sir, to my power.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLO.">
  <li class="number">Ay, by any means prove a tall fellow. If I do not wonder how thou dar’st venture to be drunk, not being a tall fellow, trust me not. Hark, the kings and the princes, our kindred, are going to see the Queen’s picture. Come, follow us; we’ll be thy good masters.</li>

  <li class="number">It is requir’d</li>
  <li class="number">You do awake your faith. Then, all stand still.</li>
  <li class="number">On; those that think it is unlawful business</li>
  <li class="number">I am about, let them depart.</li>

  <li class="number">Ay, and make it manifest where she has liv’d,</li>

<ol data-speaker="PAUL.">
  <li class="number">That she is living,</li>
  <li class="number">Were it but told you, should be hooted at</li>

  <li class="number">Though yet she speak not. Mark a little while.</li>
  <li class="number">Please you to interpose, fair madam, kneel,</li>
  <li class="number">And pray your mother’s blessing. Turn, good lady,</li>
  <li class="number">Our Perdita is found.</li>

<ol data-speaker="HER.">
  <li class="number">You gods, look down</li>
  <li class="number">And from your sacred vials pour your graces</li>
  <li class="number">Upon my daughter’s head! Tell me, mine own,</li>
  <li class="number">Where hast thou been preserv’d? Where liv’d? How found</li>
  <li class="number">Thy father’s court? For thou shalt hear that I,</li>
  <li class="number">Knowing by Paulina that the oracle</li>
  <li class="number">Gave hope thou wast in being, have preserv’d</li>
  <li class="number">Myself to see the issue.</li>

<ol data-speaker="PAUL.">
  <li class="number">There’s time enough for that;</li>
  <li class="number">Least they desire (upon this push) to trouble</li>
  <li class="number">Your joys with like relation. Go together,</li>
  <li class="number">You precious winners all; your exultation</li>
  <li class="number">Partake to every one. I, an old turtle,</li>
  <li class="number">Will wing me to some wither’d bough, and there</li>
  <li class="number">My mate (that’s never to be found again)</li>
  <li class="number">Lament till I am lost.</li>

<ol data-speaker="LEON.">
  <li class="number">O, peace, Paulina!</li>
  <li class="number">Thou shouldst a husband take by my consent,</li>
  <li class="number">As I by thine a wife: this is a match,</li>
  <li class="number">And made between ’s by vows. Thou hast found mine,</li>
  <li class="number">But how, is to be question’d; for I saw her</li>
  <li class="number">(As I thought) dead; and have (in vain) said many</li>
  <li class="number">A prayer upon her grave. I’ll not seek far</li>
  <li class="number">(For him, I partly know his mind) to find thee</li>
  <li class="number">An honorable husband. Come, Camillo,</li>
  <li class="number">And take her by the hand, whose worth and honesty</li>
  <li class="number">Is richly noted; and here justified</li>
  <li class="number">By us, a pair of kings. Let’s from this place.</li>
  <li class="number">What? Look upon my brother. Both your pardons,</li>
  <li class="number">That e’er I put between your holy looks</li>
  <li class="number">My ill suspicion. This’ your son-in-law,</li>
  <li class="number">And son unto the King, whom heavens directing</li>
  <li class="number">Is troth-plight to your daughter. Good Paulina,</li>
  <li class="number">Lead us from hence, where we may leisurely</li>
  <li class="number">Each one demand, and answer to his part</li>
  <li class="number">Perform’d in this wide gap of time, since first</li>
  <li class="number">We were dissever’d. Hastily lead away.</li>
