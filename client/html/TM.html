<h3>Scene 1</h3>

<h4>London. A street.</h4>

<div class="stage-direction">
	Enter, at one end, John Lincoln, with the two Bettses together; at the other end, enters Francis de Barde and Doll a lusty woman, he haling her by the arm.
	
		LINCOLN.
		GEORGE.
		CLOWN.
		BARDE.
		DOLL.
	
</div>

<ol data-speaker="DOLL.">
  <li class="number">Whether wilt thou hale me?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BARDE.">
  <li class="number">Whether I please; thou art my prize, and I plead purchase of thee.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DOLL.">
  <li class="number">Purchase of me? Away, ye rascal! I am an honest plain carpenter’s wife, and though I have no beauty to like a husband, yet whatsoever is mine scorns to stoop to a stranger. Hand off, then, when I bid thee!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BARDE.">
  <li class="number">Go with me quietly, or I’ll compel thee.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DOLL.">
  <li class="number">Compel me, ye dog’s face! Thou thinkst thou hast the goldsmith’s wife in hand, whom thou enticed’st from her husband with all his plate, and when thou turnd’st her home to him again, mad’st him, like an ass, pay for his wife’s board.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BARDE.">
  <li class="number">So will I make thy husband too, if please me.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">
	Enter Caveler with a pair of doves; Williamson the carpenter, and Sherwin following him.
	
		CAVELER.
		WILLIAMSON.
		SHERWIN.
	
</div>

<ol data-speaker="DOLL.">
  <li class="number">Here he comes himself; tell him so, if thou dar’st.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAVELER.">
  <li class="number">Follow me no further; I say thou shalt not have them.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WILLIAMSON.">
  <li class="number">I bought them in Cheapside, and paid my money for them.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHERWIN.">
  <li class="number">He did, sir, indeed; and you offer him wrong, both to take them from him, and not restore him his money neither.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAVELER.">
  <li class="number">If he paid for them, let it suffice that I possess them. Beefs and brews may serve such hinds. Are pigeons meat for a coarse carpenter?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LINCOLN.">
  <li class="number">It is hard when Englishmen’s patience must be thus jetted on by strangers, and they not dare to revenge their own wrongs.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GEORGE.">
  <li class="number">Lincoln, let’s beat them down, and bear no more of these abuses.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LINCOLN.">
  <li class="number">We may not, Betts. Be patient, and hear more.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DOLL.">
  <li class="number">How now, husband! What, one stranger take they food from thee, and another thy wife! By our Lady, flesh and blood, I think, can hardly brook that.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LINCOLN.">
  <li class="number">Will this gear never be otherwise? Must these wrongs be thus endured?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GEORGE.">
  <li class="number">Let us step in, and help to revenge their injury.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BARDE.">
  <li class="number">What art thou that talkest of revenge? My lord ambassador shall once more make your Major have a check, if he punish thee for this saucy presumption.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WILLIAMSON.">
  <li class="number">Indeed, my lord Mayor, on the ambassador’s complaint, sent me to Newgate one day, because (against my will) I took the wall of a stranger. You may do any thing; the goldsmith’s wife and mine now must be at your commandment.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GEORGE.">
  <li class="number">The more patient fools are ye both, to suffer it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BARDE.">
  <li class="number">Suffer it! Mend it thou or he, if ye can or dare. I tell thee, fellows, and she were the Mayor of London’s wife, had I her once in my possession, I would keep her in spite of him that durst say nay.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GEORGE.">
  <li class="number">I tell thee, Lombard, these words should cost thy best cape, were I not curbed by duty and obedience. The Mayor of London’s wife! Oh God, shall it be thus?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DOLL.">
  <li class="number">Why, Betts, am not I as dear to my husband as my lord Mayor’s wife to him? And wilt thou so neglectly suffer thine own shame?—Hands off, proud stranger! Or, by him that bought me, if men’s milky hearts dare not strike a stranger, yet women beat them down, ere they bear these abuses.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BARDE.">
  <li class="number">Mistress, I say you shall along with me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DOLL.">
  <li class="number">Touch not Doll Williamson, least she lay thee along on God’s dear earth.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">
	To Caveler.
	
		DOLL.
		CAVELER.
	
</li>
  <li class="number">And you, sir, that allow such coarse cates to carpenters, whilst pigeons, which they pay for, must serve your dainty appetite, deliver them back to my husband again, or I’ll call so many women to mine assistance as will not leave one inch untorn of thee. If our husbands must be bridled by law, and forced to bear your wrongs, their wives will be a little lawless, and soundly beat ye.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAVELER.">
  <li class="number">Come away, De Barde, and let us go complain to my lord ambassador.</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">
	Exeunt Ambo.
	
		CAVELER.
		BARDE.
	
</div>

<ol data-speaker="DOLL.">
  <li class="number">Aye, go, and send him among us, and we’ll give him his welcome too. I am ashamed that freeborn Englishmen, having beaten strangers within their own homes, should thus be braved and abused by them at home.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHERWIN.">
  <li class="number">It is not our lack of courage in the cause, but the strict obedience that we are bound to. I am the goldsmith whose wrongs you talked of; but how to redress yours or mine own is a matter beyond our abilities.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LINCOLN.">
  <li class="number">Not so, not so, my good friends. I, though a mean man, a broker by profession, and named John Lincoln, have long time winked at these wild enormities with mighty impatience, and, as these two brethren here (Betts by name) can witness, with loss of mine own life would gladly remedy them.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GEORGE.">
  <li class="number">And he is in a good forwardness, I tell ye, if all hit right.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DOLL.">
  <li class="number">As how, I prithee? Tell it to Doll Williamson.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LINCOLN.">
  <li class="number">You know the Spittle sermons begin the next week. I have drawn a bill of our wrongs and the strangers’ insolences.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GEORGE.">
  <li class="number">Which he means the preachers shall there openly publish in the pulpit.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WILLIAMSON.">
  <li class="number">Oh, but that they would! I’faith, it would tickle our strangers thoroughly.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DOLL.">
  <li class="number">Aye, and if you men durst not undertake it, before God, we women would. Take an honest woman from her husband! Why, it is intolerable.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHERWIN.">
  <li class="number">But how find ye the preachers affected to our proceeding?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LINCOLN.">
  <li class="number">Master Doctor Standish hath answered that it becomes not him to move any such thing in his sermon, and tells us we must move the Mayor and aldermen to reform it, and doubts not but happy success will ensue on statement of our wrongs. You shall perceive there’s no hurt in the bill. Here’s a couple of it; I pray ye, hear it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ALL.">
  <li class="number">With all our hearts; for God’s sake, read it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LINCOLN.">
  <li class="stage-direction">
	Reads.
	
		LINCOLN.
	
</li>
  <li class="number"><recite>“To you all, the worshipful lords and masters of this city, that will take compassion over the poor people your neighbors, and also of the great importable hurts, losses, and hinderances, whereof proceedeth extreme poverty to all the king’s subjects that inhabit within this city and suburbs of the same. For so it is that aliens and strangers eat the bread from the fatherless children, and take the living from all the artificers and the intercourse from all the merchants, whereby poverty is so much increased, that every man bewaileth the misery of other; for craftsmen be brought to beggary, and merchants to neediness. Wherefore, the premises considered, the redress must be of the common knit and united to one part. And as the hurt and damage grieveth all men, so must all men see to their willing power for remedy, and not suffer the said aliens in their wealth, and the natural born men of this region to come to confusion.”</recite></li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DOLL.">
  <li class="number">Before God, ’tis excellent; and I’ll maintain the suit to be honest.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHERWIN.">
  <li class="number">Well, say ’tis read, what is your further meaning in the matter?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GEORGE.">
  <li class="number">What? Marry, list to me. No doubt but this will store us with friends enow, whose names we will closely keep in writing; and on May day next in the morning we’ll go forth a Maying, but make it the worst May day for the strangers that ever they saw. How say ye? Do ye subscribe, or are ye faint-hearted revolters?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DOLL.">
  <li class="number">Hold thee, George Betts, there’s my hand and my heart. By the Lord, I’ll make a captain among ye, and do somewhat to be talk of forever after.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="WILLIAMSON.">
  <li class="number">My masters, ere we part, let’s friendly go and drink together, and swear true secrecy upon our lives.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GEORGE.">
  <li class="number">There spake an angel. Come, let us along, then.</li>

<ol data-speaker="LORD MAYOR.">
  <li class="number">Having dispatched our weightier businesses,</li>
  <li class="number">We may give ear to petty felonies.</li>
  <li class="number">Master Sheriff More, what is this fellow?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MORE.">
  <li class="number">My lord, he stands indicted for a purse;</li>
  <li class="number">He hath been tried, the jury is together.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LORD MAYOR.">
  <li class="number">Who sent him in?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SURESBY.">
  <li class="number">That did I, my lord:</li>
  <li class="number">Had he had right, he had been hanged ere this;</li>
  <li class="number">The only captain of the cutpurse crew.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LORD MAYOR.">
  <li class="number">What is his name?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SURESBY.">
  <li class="number">As his profession is, Lifter, my lord,</li>
  <li class="number">One that can lift a purse right cunningly.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LORD MAYOR.">
  <li class="number">And is that he accuses him?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SURESBY.">
  <li class="number">The same, my lord, whom, by your honors leave,</li>
  <li class="number">I must say somewhat too, because I find</li>
  <li class="number">In some respects he is well worthy blame.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LORD MAYOR.">
  <li class="number">Good Master Justice Suresby, speak your mind;</li>
  <li class="number">We are well pleased to give you audience.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SURESBY.">
  <li class="number">Hear me, Smart; thou art a foolish fellow:</li>
  <li class="number">If Lifter be convicted by the law,</li>
  <li class="number">As I see not how the jury can acquit him,</li>
  <li class="number">I’ll stand too ’t thou art guilty of his death.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MORE.">
  <li class="number">My lord, that’s worthy the hearing.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LORD MAYOR.">
  <li class="number">Listen, then, good Master More.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SURESBY.">
  <li class="number">I tell thee plain, it is a shame for thee,</li>
  <li class="number">With such a sum to tempt necessity;</li>
  <li class="number">No less than ten pounds, sir, will serve your turn,</li>
  <li class="number">To carry in your purse about with ye,</li>
  <li class="number">To crake and brag in taverns of your money:</li>
  <li class="number">I promise ye, a man that goes abroad</li>
  <li class="number">With an intent of truth, meeting such a booty,</li>
  <li class="number">May be provoked to that he never meant.</li>
  <li class="number">What makes so many pilferers and felons,</li>
  <li class="number">But such fond baits that foolish people lay</li>
  <li class="number">To tempt the needy miserable wretch?</li>
  <li class="number">Ten pounds, odd money; this is a pretty sum</li>
  <li class="number">To bear about, which were more safe at home.</li>
  <li class="number">’Fore God, ’twere well to fine ye as much more</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">

</li>
  <li class="number">To the relief of the poor prisoners,</li>
  <li class="number">To teach ye be more careful of your own,</li>
  <li class="number">In sooth, I say ye were but rightly served,</li>
  <li class="number">If ye had lost as much as twice ten pounds.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MORE.">
  <li class="number">Good my lord, sooth a point or two for once,</li>
  <li class="number">Only to try conclusions in this case.</li>

  <li class="number">Content, good Master More. We’ll rise awhile,</li>

  <li class="number">What is your worship’s pleasure?</li>

<ol data-speaker="MORE.">
  <li class="number">Sirrah, you know that you are known to me,</li>
  <li class="number">And I have often saved ye from this place,</li>
  <li class="number">Since first I came in office. Thou seest beside,</li>
  <li class="number">That Justice Suresby is thy heavy friend,</li>
  <li class="number">By all the blame that he pretends to Smart,</li>
  <li class="number">For tempting thee with such a sum of money.</li>
  <li class="number">I tell thee what; devise me but a means</li>
  <li class="number">To pick or cut his purse, and, on my credit,</li>
  <li class="number">And as I am a Christian and a man,</li>
  <li class="number">I will procure they pardon for that jest.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LIFTER.">
  <li class="number">Good Master Sheriff, seek not my overthrow:</li>
  <li class="number">You know, sir, I have many heavy friends,</li>
  <li class="number">And more indictments like to come upon me.</li>
  <li class="number">You are too deep for me to deal withal;</li>
  <li class="number">You are known to be one of the wisest men</li>
  <li class="number">That is in England. I pray ye, Master Sheriff,</li>
  <li class="number">Go not about to undermine my life.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MORE.">
  <li class="number">Lifter, I am true subject to my king;</li>
  <li class="number">Thou much mistak’st me. And, for thou shall not think</li>
  <li class="number">I mean by this to hurt thy life at all,</li>
  <li class="number">I will maintain the act when thou hast done it.</li>
  <li class="number">Thou knowest there are such matters in my hands,</li>
  <li class="number">As if I pleased to give them to the jury,</li>
  <li class="number">I should not need this way to circumvent thee.</li>
  <li class="number">All that I aim at is a merry jest:</li>
  <li class="number">Perform it, Lifter, and expect my best.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LIFTER.">
  <li class="number">I thank your worship. God preserve your life!</li>
  <li class="number">But Master Justice Suresby is gone in;</li>
  <li class="number">I know not how to come near where he is.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MORE.">
  <li class="number">Let me alone for that; I’ll be thy setter;</li>
  <li class="number">I’ll send him hither to thee presently,</li>
  <li class="number">Under the color of thine own request</li>
  <li class="number">Of private matters to acquaint him with.</li>

<ol data-speaker="MORE.">
  <li class="number">Well said. But see that thou diminish not</li>
  <li class="number">One penny of the money, but give it me;</li>
  <li class="number">It is the cunning act that credits thee.</li>

</li>
  <li class="number">I see the purpose of this gentleman</li>

<ol data-speaker="SHREWSBURY.">
  <li class="number">My lord of Surrey, and Sir Thomas Palmer</li>
  <li class="number">Might I with patience tempt your grave advice,</li>
  <li class="number">I tell ye true, that in these dangerous times</li>
  <li class="number">I do not like this frowning vulgar brow:</li>
  <li class="number">My searching eye did never entertain</li>
  <li class="number">A more distracted countenance of grief</li>
  <li class="number">Than I have late observed</li>
  <li class="number">In the displeased commons of the city.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SURREY.">
  <li class="number">’Tis strange that from his princely clemency,</li>
  <li class="number">So well a tempered mercy and a grace,</li>
  <li class="number">To all the aliens in this fruitful land,</li>
  <li class="number">That this high-crested insolence should spring</li>
  <li class="number">From them that breathe from his majestic bounty,</li>
  <li class="number">That, fattened with the traffic of our country,</li>
  <li class="number">Already leaps into his subjects’ face.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PALMER.">
  <li class="number">Yet Sherwin, hindered to commence his suit</li>
  <li class="number">Against de Barde by the ambassador,</li>
  <li class="number">By supplication made unto the king,</li>
  <li class="number">Who, having first enticed away his wife</li>
  <li class="number">And got his plate, near worth four hundred pound,</li>
  <li class="number">To grieve some wronged citizens that found</li>
  <li class="number">This vile disgrace oft cast into their teeth,</li>
  <li class="number">Of late sues Sherwin, and arrested him</li>
  <li class="number">For money for the boarding of his wife.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SURREY.">
  <li class="number">The more knave Barde, that, using Sherwin’s goods,</li>
  <li class="number">Doth ask him interest for the occupation.</li>
  <li class="number">I like not that, my lord of Shrewsbury:</li>
  <li class="number">He’s ill bested that lends a well-paced horse</li>
  <li class="number">Unto a man that will not find him meet.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CHOLMLEY.">
  <li class="number">My lord of Surrey will be pleasant still.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PALMER.">
  <li class="number">Aye, being then employed by your honors</li>
  <li class="number">To stay the broil that fell about the same,</li>
  <li class="number">Where by persuasion I enforced the wrongs,</li>
  <li class="number">And urged the grief of the displeased city,</li>
  <li class="number">He answered me, and with a solemn oath,</li>
  <li class="number">That, if he had the Mayor of London’s wife,</li>
  <li class="number">He would keep her in despite of any English.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SURREY.">
  <li class="number">’Tis good, Sir Thomas, then, for you and me;</li>
  <li class="number">Your wife is dead, and I a bachelor:</li>
  <li class="number">If no man can possess his wife alone,</li>
  <li class="number">I am glad, Sir Thomas Palmer, I have none.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CHOLMLEY.">
  <li class="number">If a take a wife, ’a shall find her meet.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SURREY.">
  <li class="number">And reason good, Sir Roger Cholmley, too.</li>
  <li class="number">If these hot Frenchmen needsly will have sport,</li>
  <li class="number">They should in kindness yet defray the charge:</li>
  <li class="number">’Tis hard when men possess our wives in quiet,</li>
  <li class="number">And yet leave us in, to discharge their diet.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHREWSBURY.">
  <li class="number">My lord, our caters shall not use the market</li>
  <li class="number">For our provision, but some stranger now</li>
  <li class="number">Will take the vittailes from him he hath bought:</li>
  <li class="number">A carpenter, as I was late informed,</li>
  <li class="number">Who having bought a pair of doves in Cheap,</li>
  <li class="number">Immediately a Frenchman took them from him,</li>
  <li class="number">And beat the poor man for resisting him;</li>
  <li class="number">And when the fellow did complain his wrongs,</li>
  <li class="number">He was severely punished for his labor.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SURREY.">
  <li class="number">But if the English blood be once but up,</li>
  <li class="number">As I perceive their hearts already full,</li>
  <li class="number">I fear me much, before their spleens be cold,</li>
  <li class="number">Some of these saucy aliens for their pride</li>
  <li class="number">Will pay for ’t soundly, wheresoe’er it lights:</li>
  <li class="number">This tide of rage that with the eddy strives,</li>
  <li class="number">I fear me much, will drown too many lives.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CHOLMLEY.">
  <li class="number">Now, afore God, your honors, pardon me:</li>
  <li class="number">Men of your place and greatness are to blame.</li>
  <li class="number">I tell ye true, my lords, in that his majesty</li>
  <li class="number">Is not informed of this base abuse</li>
  <li class="number">And daily wrongs are offered to his subjects;</li>
  <li class="number">For, if he were, I know his gracious wisdom</li>
  <li class="number">Would soon redress it.</li>

  <li class="number">Is threatened, if he come out of his house.</li>
  <li class="number">A number poor artificers are up</li>

<ol data-speaker="CHOLMLEY.">

  <li class="number">On supposition; which if you will mark,</li>
  <li class="number">You shall perceive how horrible a shape</li>

  <li class="number">Which oft the apostle did forewarn us of,</li>
  <li class="number">Urging obedience to authority;</li>
  <li class="number">And ’twere no error, if I told you all,</li>
  <li class="number">You were in arms against your God himself.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ALL.">
  <li class="number">Marry, God forbid that!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MORE.">
  <li class="number">Nay, certainly you are;</li>
  <li class="number">For to the king God hath his office lent</li>
  <li class="number">Of dread, of justice, power and command,</li>
  <li class="number">Hath bid him rule, and willed you to obey;</li>
  <li class="number">And, to add ampler majesty to this,</li>
  <li class="number">He hath not only lent the king his figure,</li>
  <li class="number">His throne and sword, but given him his own name,</li>
  <li class="number">Calls him a god on earth. What do you, then,</li>
  <li class="number">Rising ’gainst him that God himself installs,</li>
  <li class="number">But rise against God? What do you to your souls</li>
  <li class="number">In doing this? O, desperate as you are,</li>
  <li class="number">Wash your foul minds with tears, and those same hands,</li>
  <li class="number">That you like rebels lift against the peace,</li>
  <li class="number">Lift up for peace, and your unreverent knees,</li>
  <li class="number">Make them your feet to kneel to be forgiven!</li>
  <li class="number">Tell me but this. What rebel captain,</li>
  <li class="number">As mutinies are incident, by his name</li>
  <li class="number">Can still the rout? Who will obey a traitor?</li>
  <li class="number">Or how can well that proclamation sound,</li>
  <li class="number">When there is no addition but a rebel</li>
  <li class="number">To qualify a rebel? You’ll put down strangers,</li>
  <li class="number">Kill them, cut their throats, possess their houses,</li>
  <li class="number">And lead the majesty of law in line,</li>
  <li class="number">To slip him like a hound. Say now the king</li>
  <li class="number">(As he is clement, if th’ offender mourn)</li>
  <li class="number">Should so much come to short of your great trespass</li>
  <li class="number">As but to banish you, whether would you go?</li>
  <li class="number">What country, by the nature of your error,</li>
  <li class="number">Should give you harbor? Go you to France or Flanders,</li>
  <li class="number">To any German province, to Spain or Portugal,</li>
  <li class="number">Nay, any where that not adheres to England,—</li>
  <li class="number">Why, you must needs be strangers. Would you be pleased</li>
  <li class="number">To find a nation of such barbarous temper,</li>
  <li class="number">That, breaking out in hideous violence,</li>
  <li class="number">Would not afford you an abode on earth,</li>
  <li class="number">Whet their detested knives against your throats,</li>
  <li class="number">Spurn you like dogs, and like as if that God</li>
  <li class="number">Owed not nor made not you, nor that the claimants</li>
  <li class="number">Were not all appropriate to your comforts,</li>
  <li class="number">But chartered unto them, what would you think</li>
  <li class="number">To be thus used? This is the strangers’ case;</li>

<ol data-speaker="SURREY.">
  <li class="number">My lords, as ’tis the custom in this place</li>
  <li class="number">The youngest should speak first, so, if I chance</li>
  <li class="number">In this case to speak youngly, pardon me.</li>
  <li class="number">I will agree, France now hath her full strength,</li>
  <li class="number">As having new recovered the pale blood</li>
  <li class="number">Which war sluiced forth; and I consent to this,</li>
  <li class="number">That the conjunction of our English forces</li>
  <li class="number">With arms of Germany may soon bring</li>
  <li class="number">This prize of conquest in. But, then, my lords,</li>
  <li class="number">As in the moral hunting ’twixt the lion</li>
  <li class="number">And other beasts, force joined with greed</li>
  <li class="number">Frighted the weaker sharers from their parts;</li>
  <li class="number">So, if the empire’s sovereign chance to put</li>
  <li class="number">His plea of partnership into war’s court,</li>
  <li class="number">Swords should decide the difference, and our blood</li>

<ol data-speaker="SHREWSBURY.">
  <li class="number">To doubt the worst is still the wise man’s shield,</li>
  <li class="number">That arms him safely. But the world knows this,</li>
  <li class="number">The Emperor is a man of royal faith;</li>
  <li class="number">His love unto our sovereign brings him down</li>
  <li class="number">From his imperial seat, to march in pay</li>
  <li class="number">Under our English flag, and wear the cross,</li>
  <li class="number">Like some high order, on his manly breast;</li>

  <li class="number">Of their true sovereign, other than the merit</li>
  <li class="number">That from the sovereign guerdons the true subject;</li>
  <li class="number">So the good Emperor, in a friendly league</li>

<h4>Chelsea.</h4>

<div class="stage-direction">
	Enter the Lady More, her two Daughters, and Master Roper, as walking.
	
		LADY MORE.
		BOTH DAUGHTERS.
		ROPER.
	
</div>

<ol data-speaker="ROPER.">
  <li class="number">Madame, what ails ye for to look so sad?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LADY MORE.">
  <li class="number">Troth, son, I know not what; I am not sick,</li>
  <li class="number">And yet I am not well. I would be merry;</li>
  <li class="number">But somewhat lies so heavy on heart,</li>
  <li class="number">I cannot choose but sigh. You are a scholar;</li>
  <li class="number">I pray ye, tell me, may one credit dreams?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROPER.">
  <li class="number">Why ask you that, dear madame?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LADY MORE.">
  <li class="number">Because tonight I had the strangest dream</li>
  <li class="number">That ere my sleep was troubled with. Methought ’twas night,</li>
  <li class="number">And that the King and Queen went on the Thames</li>
  <li class="number">In barges to hear music. My lord and I</li>
  <li class="number">Were in a little boat methought,—Lord, Lord,</li>
  <li class="number">What strange things live in slumbers!—and, being near,</li>
  <li class="number">We grappled to the barge that bare the king.</li>
  <li class="number">But after many pleasing voices spent</li>
  <li class="number">In that still moving music house, methought</li>
  <li class="number">The violence of the stream did sever us</li>
  <li class="number">Quite from the golden fleet, and hurried us</li>
  <li class="number">Unto the bridge, which with unused horror</li>
  <li class="number">We entered at full tide. Thence some slight shoot</li>
  <li class="number">Being carried by the waves, our boat stood still</li>
  <li class="number">Just opposite the Tower, and there it turned</li>
  <li class="number">And turned about, as when a whirl-pool sucks</li>
  <li class="number">The circled waters. Methought that we both cried,</li>
  <li class="number">Till that we sunk. Where arm in arm we died.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROPER.">
  <li class="number">Give no respect, dear madame, to fond dreams:</li>
  <li class="number">They are but slight illusions of the blood.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LADY MORE.">
  <li class="number">Tell me not all are so; for often dreams</li>
  <li class="number">Are true diviners, either of good or ill:</li>
  <li class="number">I cannot be in quiet till I hear</li>

  <li class="number">Beyond all thought.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROP. WIFE.">
  <li class="number">Truly, and so have I:</li>
  <li class="number">Methought I saw him here in Chelsea Church,</li>

  <li class="number">And whilst he kneeled and prayed before the image,</li>
  <li class="number">It fell with him into the upper-choir,</li>
  <li class="number">Where my poor father lay all stained in blood.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROPER.">
  <li class="number">Our dreams all meet in one conclusion,</li>

  <li class="number">Hence slaves have their creation; and I think</li>
  <li class="number">Nature provides content for the base mind;</li>
  <li class="number">Under the whip, the burden, and the toil,</li>
  <li class="number">Their low-wrought bodies drudge in patience;</li>
  <li class="number">As for the prince in all his sweet-gorged maw,</li>
  <li class="number">And his rank flesh, that sinfully renews</li>
  <li class="number">The noon’s excess in the night’s dangerous surfeits.</li>
  <li class="number">What means or misery from our birth doth flow</li>
  <li class="number">Nature entitles to us; that we owe:</li>
  <li class="number">But we, being subject to the rack of hate,</li>
  <li class="number">Falling from happy life to bondage state,</li>
  <li class="number">Having seen better days, now know the lack</li>
