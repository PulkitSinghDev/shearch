  <li class="number">I thought the King had more affected the Duke of Albany than Cornwall.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li class="number">It did always seem so to us; but now in the division of the kingdom, it appears not which of the Dukes he values most, for equalities are so weigh’d, that curiosity in neither can make choice of either’s moi’ty.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KENT.">
  <li class="number">Is not this your son, my lord?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li class="number">His breeding, sir, hath been at my charge. I have so often blush’d to acknowledge him, that now I am braz’d to’t.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KENT.">
  <li class="number">I cannot conceive you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li class="number">Sir, this young fellow’s mother could; whereupon she grew round-womb’d, and had indeed, sir, a son for her cradle ere she had a husband for her bed. Do you smell a fault?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KENT.">
  <li class="number">I cannot wish the fault undone, the issue of it being so proper.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li class="number">But I have a son, sir, by order of law, some year elder than this, who yet is no dearer in my account. Though this knave came something saucily to the world before he was sent for, yet was his mother fair, there was good sport at his making, and the whoreson must be acknowledg’d. Do you know this noble gentleman, Edmund?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="EDM.">
  <li class="number">No, my lord.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li class="number">My Lord of Kent. Remember him hereafter as my honorable friend.</li>

  <li class="number">Mean time we shall express our darker purpose.</li>

  <li class="number">To shake all cares and business from our age,</li>
  <li class="number">Conferring them on younger strengths, while we</li>

  <li class="number">We have this hour a constant will to publish</li>
  <li class="number">Our daughters’ several dowers, that future strife</li>
  <li class="number">May be prevented now. The princes, France and Burgundy,</li>
  <li class="number">Great rivals in our youngest daughter’s love,</li>
  <li class="number">Long in our court have made their amorous sojourn,</li>
  <li class="number">And here are to be answer’d. Tell me, my daughters</li>
  <li class="number">(Since now we will divest us both of rule,</li>
  <li class="number">Interest of territory, cares of state),</li>
  <li class="number">Which of you shall we say doth love us most,</li>

<ol data-speaker="GON.">
  <li class="number">Sir, I love you more than words can wield the matter,</li>
  <li class="number">Dearer than eyesight, space, and liberty,</li>
  <li class="number">Beyond what can be valued, rich or rare,</li>
  <li class="number">No less than life, with grace, health, beauty, honor;</li>
  <li class="number">As much as child e’er lov’d, or father found;</li>
  <li class="number">A love that makes breath poor, and speech unable:</li>

<ol data-speaker="REG.">
  <li class="number">I am made of that self metal as my sister,</li>

  <li class="number">Only she comes too short, that I profess</li>
  <li class="number">Myself an enemy to all other joys</li>
  <li class="number">Which the most precious square of sense possesses,</li>

<ol data-speaker="LEAR.">
  <li class="number">To thee and thine hereditary ever</li>
  <li class="number">Remain this ample third of our fair kingdom,</li>
  <li class="number">No less in space, validity, and pleasure,</li>

<ol data-speaker="LEAR.">
  <li class="number">How, how, Cordelia? Mend your speech a little,</li>

<ol data-speaker="COR.">
  <li class="number">Good my lord,</li>

  <li class="number">Obey you, love you, and most honor you.</li>
  <li class="number">Why have my sisters husbands, if they say</li>
  <li class="number">They love you all? Happily, when I shall wed,</li>
  <li class="number">That lord whose hand must take my plight shall carry</li>
  <li class="number">Half my love with him, half my care and duty.</li>
  <li class="number">Sure I shall never marry like my sisters,</li>

  <li class="number">So young, and so untender?</li>

<ol data-speaker="LEAR.">
  <li class="number">Let it be so: thy truth then be thy dow’r!</li>

  <li class="number">By all the operation of the orbs,</li>
  <li class="number">From whom we do exist and cease to be;</li>
  <li class="number">Here I disclaim all my paternal care,</li>
  <li class="number">Propinquity and property of blood,</li>
  <li class="number">And as a stranger to my heart and me</li>
  <li class="number">Hold thee from this forever. The barbarous Scythian,</li>
  <li class="number">Or he that makes his generation messes</li>
  <li class="number">To gorge his appetite, shall to my bosom</li>
  <li class="number">Be as well neighbor’d, pitied, and reliev’d,</li>

  <li class="number">When Lear is mad. What wouldest thou do, old man?</li>
  <li class="number">Think’st thou that duty shall have dread to speak</li>
  <li class="number">When power to flattery bows? To plainness honor’s bound,</li>
  <li class="number">When majesty falls to folly. Reserve thy state,</li>
  <li class="number">And in thy best consideration check</li>
  <li class="number">This hideous rashness. Answer my life my judgment,</li>
  <li class="number">Thy youngest daughter does not love thee least,</li>

  <li class="number">My Lord of Burgundy,</li>
  <li class="number">We first address toward you, who with this king</li>
  <li class="number">Hath rivall’d for our daughter. What, in the least,</li>
  <li class="number">Will you require in present dower with her,</li>
  <li class="number">Or cease your quest of love?</li>

<ol data-speaker="BUR.">
  <li class="number">Most royal Majesty,</li>
  <li class="number">I crave no more than hath your Highness offer’d,</li>
  <li class="number">Nor will you tender less.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LEAR.">
  <li class="number">Right noble Burgundy,</li>
  <li class="number">When she was dear to us, we did hold her so,</li>
  <li class="number">But now her price is fallen. Sir, there she stands:</li>
  <li class="number">If aught within that little seeming substance,</li>
  <li class="number">Or all of it, with our displeasure piec’d,</li>
  <li class="number">And nothing more, may fitly like your Grace,</li>

</li>
  <li class="number">For you, great King,</li>
  <li class="number">I would not from your love make such a stray</li>
  <li class="number">To match you where I hate; therefore beseech you</li>
  <li class="number">T’ avert your liking a more worthier way</li>

  <li class="number">Must be of such unnatural degree</li>
  <li class="number">That monsters it, or your fore-vouch’d affection</li>
  <li class="number">Fall into taint; which to believe of her</li>
  <li class="number">Must be a faith that reason without miracle</li>

  <li class="number">I yet beseech your Majesty—</li>
  <li class="number">If for I want that glib and oily art</li>
  <li class="number">To speak and purpose not, since what I well intend,</li>
  <li class="number">I’ll do’t before I speak—that you make known</li>
  <li class="number">It is no vicious blot, murder, or foulness,</li>
  <li class="number">No unchaste action, or dishonored step,</li>
  <li class="number">That hath depriv’d me of your grace and favor,</li>
  <li class="number">But even for want of that for which I am richer—</li>
  <li class="number">A still-soliciting eye, and such a tongue</li>

  <li class="number">Hath lost me in your liking.</li>

  <li class="number">These late eclipses in the sun and moon portend no good to us. Though the wisdom of nature can reason it thus and thus, yet nature finds itself scourg’d by the sequent effects. Love cools, friendship falls off, brothers divide: in cities, mutinies; in countries, discord; in palaces, treason; and the bond crack’d ’twixt son and father. This villain of mine comes under the prediction; 
there’s son against father: the King falls from bias of nature; there’s father against child. We have seen the best of our time. Machinations, hollowness, treachery, and all ruinous disorders follow us disquietly to our graves. Find out this villain, Edmund, it shall lose thee nothing, do it carefully. 
And the noble and true-hearted Kent banish’d! His offense, honesty! ’Tis strange.</li>

  <li class="number">This is the excellent foppery of the world, that when we are sick in fortune—often the surfeits of our own behavior—we make guilty of our disasters the sun, the moon, and stars, as if we were villains on necessity, fools by heavenly compulsion, knaves, thieves, and treachers by spherical predominance; drunkards, liars, and adulterers by an enforc’d obedience of planetary influence; and all that we are evil in, by a divine thrusting on. An admirable evasion of whoremaster man, to lay his goatish disposition on the charge of a star! My father compounded with my mother under the Dragon’s tail, and my nativity was under Ursa Major, so that it follows, I am rough and lecherous.

Bless thy five wits! Tom’s a-cold—O do de, do de, do de. Bless thee from whirlwinds, star-blasting, and taking! Do poor Tom some charity, whom the foul fiend vexes.

Wine lov’d I deeply, dice dearly; and in woman out-paramour’d the Turk. False of heart, light of ear, bloody of hand; hog in sloth, fox in stealth, wolf in greediness, dog in madness, lion in prey. Let not the creaking of shoes nor the rustling of silks betray thy poor heart to woman. Keep thy foot out of brothels, thy hand out of plackets, thy pen from lenders’ books, and defy the foul fiend. Still through the hawthorn blows the cold wind: says suum, mun, nonny. Dolphin my boy, boy, <foreign xml:lang="fr">sessa</foreign>! Let him trot by.</li>

<ol data-speaker="KENT.">
  <li class="number">Why the King of France is so suddenly gone back, know you no reason?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. GENT.">
  <li class="number">Something he left imperfect in the state, which since his coming forth is thought of, which imports to the kingdom so much fear and danger that his personal return was most requir’d and necessary.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KENT.">
  <li class="number">Who hath he left behind him general?</li>
</ol>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KENT.">
  <li class="number">Did your letters pierce the Queen to any demonstration of grief?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. GENT.">
  <li class="number">Ay, sir, she took them, read them in my presence,</li>
  <li class="number">And now and then an ample tear trill’d down</li>
  <li class="number">Her delicate cheek. It seem’d she was a queen</li>
  <li class="number">Over her passion, who, most rebel-like,</li>
  <li class="number">Sought to be king o’er her.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KENT.">
  <li class="number">O then it mov’d her.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. GENT.">
  <li class="number">Not to a rage, patience and sorrow strove</li>
  <li class="number">Who should express her goodliest. You have seen</li>
  <li class="number">Sunshine and rain at once; her smiles and tears</li>
  <li class="number">Were like a better way: those happy smilets</li>
  <li class="number">That play’d on her ripe lip seem’d not to know</li>
  <li class="number">What guests were in her eyes, which, parted thence,</li>
  <li class="number">As pearls from diamonds dropp’d. In brief,</li>
  <li class="number">Sorrow would be a rarity most beloved,</li>
  <li class="number">If all could so become it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KENT.">
  <li class="number">Made she no verbal question?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="1. GENT.">
  <li class="number">Faith, once or twice she heav’d the name of “father”</li>
  <li class="number">Pantingly forth, as if it press’d her heart;</li>
  <li class="number">Cried, “Sisters, sisters! Shame of ladies, sisters!</li>
  <li class="number">Kent! Father! Sisters! What, i’ th’ storm? I’ th’ night?</li>
