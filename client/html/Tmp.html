  <li class="number">If by your art, my dearest father, you have</li>
  <li class="number">Put the wild waters in this roar, allay them.</li>
  <li class="number">The sky it seems would pour down stinking pitch,</li>
  <li class="number">But that the sea, mounting to th’ welkin’s cheek,</li>
  <li class="number">Dashes the fire out. O! I have suffered</li>
  <li class="number">With those that I saw suffer. A brave vessel</li>
  <li class="number">(Who had, no doubt, some noble creature in her)</li>
  <li class="number">Dash’d all to pieces! O, the cry did knock</li>
  <li class="number">Against my very heart. Poor souls, they perish’d.</li>
  <li class="number">Had I been any God of power, I would</li>
  <li class="number">Have sunk the sea within the earth or ere</li>
  <li class="number">It should the good ship so have swallow’d, and</li>
  <li class="number">The fraughting souls within her.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PROS.">
  <li class="number">Be collected,</li>
  <li class="number">No more amazement. Tell your piteous heart</li>
  <li class="number">There’s no harm done.</li>

  <li class="number">O woe the day!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PROS.">
  <li class="number">No harm:</li>
  <li class="number">I have done nothing, but in care of thee</li>
  <li class="number">(Of thee my dear one, thee my daughter), who</li>
  <li class="number">Art ignorant of what thou art, nought knowing</li>
  <li class="number">Of whence I am, nor that I am more better</li>

  <li class="number">And thy no greater father.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MIR.">
  <li class="number">More to know</li>
  <li class="number">Did never meddle with my thoughts.</li>

<ol data-speaker="PROS.">
  <li class="number">’Tis time</li>

  <li class="number">The direful spectacle of the wrack, which touch’d</li>
  <li class="number">The very virtue of compassion in thee,</li>
  <li class="number">I have with such provision in mine art</li>

  <li class="number">You have often</li>

<ol data-speaker="PROS.">
  <li class="number">The hour’s now come,</li>
  <li class="number">The very minute bids thee ope thine ear.</li>
  <li class="number">Obey, and be attentive. Canst thou remember</li>

  <li class="number">I do not think thou canst, for then thou wast not</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MIR.">
  <li class="number">’Tis far off;</li>
  <li class="number">And rather like a dream than an assurance</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PROS.">
  <li class="number">Thou hadst; and more, Miranda. But how is it</li>
  <li class="number">That this lives in thy mind? What seest thou else</li>

  <li class="number">Twelve year since, Miranda, twelve year since,</li>
  <li class="number">Thy father was the Duke of Milan and</li>

  <li class="number">Sir, are not you my father?</li>

<ol data-speaker="PROS.">
  <li class="number">Thy mother was a piece of virtue, and</li>
  <li class="number">She said thou wast my daughter; and thy father</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MIR.">
  <li class="number">O the heavens,</li>
  <li class="number">What foul play had we, that we came from thence?</li>
  <li class="number">Or blessed was’t we did?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PROS.">
  <li class="number">Both, both, my girl.</li>
  <li class="number">By foul play (as thou say’st) were we heav’d thence,</li>
  <li class="number">But blessedly holp hither.</li>

<ol data-speaker="MIR.">
  <li class="number">O, my heart bleeds</li>
  <li class="number">To think o’ th’ teen that I have turn’d you to,</li>

  <li class="number">My brother and thy uncle, call’d Antonio—</li>
  <li class="number">I pray thee mark me—that a brother should</li>
  <li class="number">Be so perfidious!—he whom next thyself</li>
  <li class="number">Of all the world I lov’d, and to him put</li>
  <li class="number">The manage of my state, as at that time</li>
  <li class="number">Through all the signories it was the first,</li>
  <li class="number">And Prospero the prime duke, being so reputed</li>
  <li class="number">In dignity, and for the liberal arts</li>
  <li class="number">Without a parallel; those being all my study,</li>
  <li class="number">The government I cast upon my brother,</li>
  <li class="number">And to my state grew stranger, being transported</li>
  <li class="number">And rapt in secret studies. Thy false uncle—</li>

<ol data-speaker="MIR.">
  <li class="number">Sir, most heedfully.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PROS.">
  <li class="number">Being once perfected how to grant suits,</li>
  <li class="number">How to deny them, who t’ advance, and who</li>
  <li class="number">To trash for overtopping, new created</li>
  <li class="number">The creatures that were mine, I say, or chang’d ’em,</li>
  <li class="number">Or else new form’d ’em; having both the key</li>

  <li class="number">To what tune pleas’d his ear, that now he was</li>
  <li class="number">The ivy which had hid my princely trunk,</li>

<ol data-speaker="MIR.">
  <li class="number">O, good sir, I do.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PROS.">
  <li class="number">I pray thee mark me.</li>
  <li class="number">I, thus neglecting worldly ends, all dedicated</li>
  <li class="number">To closeness and the bettering of my mind</li>
  <li class="number">With that which, but by being so retir’d,</li>
  <li class="number">O’er-priz’d all popular rate, in my false brother</li>
  <li class="number">Awak’d an evil nature, and my trust,</li>
  <li class="number">Like a good parent, did beget of him</li>
  <li class="number">A falsehood in its contrary, as great</li>
  <li class="number">As my trust was, which had indeed no limit,</li>
  <li class="number">A confidence sans bound. He being thus lorded,</li>
  <li class="number">Not only with what my revenue yielded,</li>
  <li class="number">But what my power might else exact—like one</li>
  <li class="number">Who having into truth, by telling of it,</li>
  <li class="number">Made such a sinner of his memory</li>
  <li class="number">To credit his own lie—he did believe</li>
  <li class="number">He was indeed the Duke, out o’ th’ substitution,</li>
  <li class="number">And executing th’ outward face of royalty</li>
  <li class="number">With all prerogative. Hence his ambition growing—</li>
  <li class="number">Dost thou hear?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MIR.">
  <li class="number">Your tale, sir, would cure deafness.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PROS.">
  <li class="number">To have no screen between this part he play’d</li>
  <li class="number">And him he play’d it for, he needs will be</li>
  <li class="number">Absolute Milan—me (poor man) my library</li>
  <li class="number">Was dukedom large enough: of temporal royalties</li>
  <li class="number">He thinks me now incapable; confederates</li>
  <li class="number">(So dry he was for sway) wi’ th’ King of Naples</li>
  <li class="number">To give him annual tribute, do him homage,</li>
  <li class="number">Subject his coronet to his crown, and bend</li>
  <li class="number">The dukedom yet unbow’d (alas, poor Milan!)</li>
  <li class="number">To most ignoble stooping.</li>

<ol data-speaker="PROS.">
  <li class="number">Now the condition.</li>
  <li class="number">This King of Naples, being an enemy</li>
  <li class="number">To me inveterate, hearkens my brother’s suit,</li>
  <li class="number">Which was, that he in lieu o’ th’ premises,</li>

  <li class="number">Should presently extirpate me and mine</li>
  <li class="number">Out of the dukedom, and confer fair Milan</li>
  <li class="number">With all the honors on my brother; whereon,</li>
  <li class="number">A treacherous army levied, one midnight</li>
  <li class="number">Fated to th’ purpose, did Antonio open</li>
  <li class="number">The gates of Milan, and i’ th’ dead of darkness</li>
  <li class="number">The ministers for th’ purpose hurried thence</li>
  <li class="number">Me and thy crying self.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="MIR.">
  <li class="number">Alack, for pity!</li>
  <li class="number">I, not rememb’ring how I cried out then,</li>
  <li class="number">Will cry it o’er again. It is a hint</li>

  <li class="number">Well demanded, wench;</li>

  <li class="number">In few, they hurried us aboard a bark,</li>

  <li class="number">A rotten carcass of a butt, not rigg’d,</li>

  <li class="number">Instinctively have quit it. There they hoist us,</li>

  <li class="number">To th’ winds, whose pity, sighing back again,</li>
  <li class="number">Did us but loving wrong.</li>

  <li class="number">O, a cherubin</li>

<ol data-speaker="ALON.">
  <li class="number">You cram these words into mine ears against</li>

  <li class="number">My son is lost and (in my rate) she too,</li>
  <li class="number">Who is so far from Italy removed</li>
  <li class="number">I ne’er again shall see her. O thou mine heir</li>
  <li class="number">Of Naples and of Milan, what strange fish</li>
  <li class="number">Hath made his meal on thee?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="FRAN.">
  <li class="number">Sir, he may live.</li>
  <li class="number">I saw him beat the surges under him,</li>
  <li class="number">And ride upon their backs. He trod the water,</li>
  <li class="number">Whose enmity he flung aside, and breasted</li>
  <li class="number">The surge most swoll’n that met him. His bold head</li>
  <li class="number">’Bove the contentious waves he kept, and oared</li>
  <li class="number">Himself with his good arms in lusty stroke</li>
  <li class="number">To th’ shore, that o’er his wave-worn basis bowed,</li>
  <li class="number">As stooping to relieve him. I not doubt</li>
  <li class="number">He came alive to land.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ALON.">
  <li class="number">No, no, he’s gone.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SEB.">
  <li class="number">Sir, you may thank yourself for this great loss,</li>
  <li class="number">That would not bless our Europe with your daughter,</li>
  <li class="number">But rather loose her to an African,</li>
  <li class="number">Where she, at least, is banish’d from your eye,</li>
  <li class="number">Who hath cause to wet the grief on’t.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ALON.">

<ol data-speaker="SEB.">
  <li class="number">You were kneel’d to, and importun’d otherwise</li>
  <li class="number">By all of us, and the fair soul herself</li>
  <li class="number">Weigh’d between loathness and obedience, at</li>
  <li class="number">Which end o’ th’ beam should bow. We have lost your son,</li>
  <li class="number">I fear forever. Milan and Naples have</li>
  <li class="number">More widows in them of this business’ making</li>
  <li class="number">Than we bring men to comfort them.</li>

  <li class="number">What stuff is this? How say you?</li>
  <li class="number">’Tis true, my brother’s daughter’s Queen of Tunis,</li>

  <li class="number">Nor lead me, like a fire-brand, in the dark</li>
  <li class="number">Out of my way, unless he bid ’em; but</li>
  <li class="number">For every trifle are they set upon me,</li>
  <li class="number">Sometime like apes that mow and chatter at me,</li>

  <li class="number">Lie tumbling in my barefoot way, and mount</li>
  <li class="number">Their pricks at my footfall; sometime am I</li>

<ol data-speaker="TRIN.">
  <li class="number">Here’s neither bush nor shrub to bear off any weather at all. And another storm brewing, I hear it sing i’ th’ wind. Yond same black cloud, yond huge one, looks like a foul bumbard that would shed his liquor. If it should thunder as it did before, I know not where to hide my head. Yond same cloud cannot choose but fall by pailfuls. What have we here? A man or a fish? Dead or alive? A fish, he smells like a fish; a very ancient and fish-like smell; a kind of, not-of-the-newest poor-John. A strange fish! Were I in England now (as once I was) and had but this fish painted, not a holiday fool there but would give a piece of silver. There would this monster make a man; any strange beast there makes a man. When they will not give a doit to relieve a lame beggar, they will lay out ten to see a dead Indian. Legg’d like a man; and his fins like arms! Warm, o’ my troth! I do now let loose my opinion, hold it no longer: this is no fish, but an islander, that hath lately suffer’d by a thunderbolt.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">
	Thunder.
	
	
</li>
  <li class="number">Alas, the storm is come again! My best way is to creep under his gaberdine; there is no other shelter hereabout. Misery acquaints a man with strange bedfellows; I will here shroud till the dregs of the storm be past.</li>
