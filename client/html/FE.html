<h1>A Funeral Elegy</h1>

  <ol>
    <li>The love I bore to your brother, and will do to his memory, hath crav'd from me this last duty of a friend; I am herein but a second to the privilege of Truth, who can warrant more in his behalf than I undertook to deliver. Exercise in this kind I will little affect, and am less addicted to, but there must be miracle in that labor which, to witness my remembrance to this departed gentleman, I would not willingly undergo. Yet whatsoever is here done, is done to him, and to him only. For whom and whose sake I will not forget to remember any friendly respects to you, or to any of those that have lov'd him for himself, and himself for his deserts.</li>
    <li>Since Time, and his predestinated end,</li>
    <li>Abridg’d the circuit of his hopeful days,</li>
    <li>Whiles both his Youth and Virtue did intend</li>
    <li class="number">The good endeavors of deserving praise,</li>
    <li>What memorable monument can last</li>
    <li>Whereon to build his never-blemish’d name</li>
    <li>But his own worth, wherein his life was grac’d—</li>
    <li>Sith as [that] ever he maintain’d the same?</li>
    <li class="number">Oblivion in the darkest day to come,</li>
    <li>When sin shall tread on merit in the dust,</li>
    <li>Cannot rase out the lamentable tomb</li>
    <li>Of his short-liv’d deserts; but still they must,</li>
    <li>Even in the hearts and memories of men,</li>
    <li class="number">Claim fit Respect, that they, in every limb</li>
    <li>Rememb’ring what he was, with comfort then</li>
    <li>May pattern out one truly good, by him.</li>
    <li>For he was truly good, if honest care</li>
    <li>Of harmless conversation may commend</li>
    <li class="number">A life free from such stains as follies are,</li>
    <li>Ill recompensed only in his end.</li>
    <li>Nor can the tongue of him who lov’d him least</li>
    <li>(If there can be minority of love</li>
    <li>To one superlative above the rest</li>
    <li class="number">Of many men in steady faith) reprove</li>
    <li>His constant temper, in the equal weight</li>
    <li>Of thankfulness and kindness: Truth doth leave</li>
    <li>Sufficient proof, he was in every right</li>
    <li>As kind to give, as thankful to receive.</li>
    <li class="number">The curious eye of a quick-brain’d survey</li>
    <li>Could scantly find a mote amidst the sun</li>
    <li>Of his too-short’ned days, or make a prey</li>
    <li>Of any faulty errors he had done—</li>
    <li>Not that he was above the spleenful sense</li>
    <li class="number">And spite of malice, but for that he had</li>
    <li>Warrant enough in his own innocence</li>
    <li>Against the sting of some in nature bad.</li>
    <li>Yet who is he so absolutely blest</li>
    <li>That lives encompass’d in a mortal frame,</li>
    <li class="number">Sometime in reputation not oppress’d</li>
    <li>By some in nothing famous but defame?</li>
    <li>Such in the By-path and the Ridgeway lurk</li>
    <li>That leads to ruin, in a smooth pretense</li>
    <li>Of what they do to be a special work</li>
    <li class="number">Of singleness, not tending to offense;</li>
    <li>Whose very virtues are, not to detract</li>
    <li>Whiles hope remains of gain (base fee of slaves),</li>
    <li>Despising chiefly men in fortunes wrack’d—</li>
    <li>But death to such gives unrememb’red graves.</li>
    <li class="number">Now therein liv’d he happy, if to be</li>
    <li>Free from detraction happiness it be.</li>
    <li>His younger years gave comfortable hope</li>
    <li>To hope for comfort in his riper youth,</li>
    <li>Which, harvest-like, did yield again the crop</li>
    <li class="number">Of Education, better’d in his truth.</li>
    <li>Those noble twins of heaven-infused races,</li>
    <li>Learning and Wit, refined in their kind</li>
    <li>Did jointly both, in their peculiar graces,</li>
    <li>Enrich the curious temple of his mind;</li>
    <li class="number">Indeed a temple, in whose precious white</li>
    <li>Sat Reason by Religion oversway’d,</li>
    <li>Teaching his other senses, with delight,</li>
    <li>How Piety and Zeal should be obey’d—</li>
    <li>Not fruitlessly in prodigal expense</li>
    <li class="number">Wasting his best of time, but so content</li>
    <li>With Reason’s golden Mean to make defense</li>
    <li>Against the assault of youth’s encouragement;</li>
    <li>As not the tide of this surrounding age</li>
    <li>(When now his father’s death had freed his will)</li>
    <li class="number">Could make him subject to the drunken rage</li>
    <li>Of such whose only glory is their ill.</li>
    <li>He from the happy knowledge of the wise</li>
    <li>Draws virtue to reprove secured fools</li>
    <li>And shuns the glad sleights of ensnaring vice</li>
    <li class="number">To spend his spring of days in sacred schools.</li>
    <li>Here gave he diet to the sick desires</li>
    <li>That day by day assault the weaker man,</li>
    <li>And with fit moderation still retires</li>
    <li>From what doth batter virtue now and then.</li>
    <li class="number">But that I not intend in full discourse</li>
    <li>To progress out his life, I could display</li>
    <li>A good man in each part exact and force</li>
    <li>The common voice to warrant what I say.</li>
    <li>For if his fate and heaven had decreed</li>
    <li class="number">That full of days he might have liv’d to see</li>
    <li>The grave in peace, the times that should succeed</li>
    <li>Had been best-speaking witnesses with me;</li>
    <li>Whose conversation so untouch’d did move</li>
    <li>Respect most in itself, as who would scan</li>
    <li class="number">His honesty and worth, by them might prove</li>
    <li>He was a kind, true, perfect gentleman—</li>
    <li>Not in the outside of disgraceful folly,</li>
    <li>Courting opinion with unfit disguise,</li>
    <li>Affecting fashions, nor addicted wholly</li>
    <li class="number">To unbeseeming blushless vanities,</li>
    <li>But suiting so his habit and desire</li>
    <li>As that his Virtue was his best Attire.</li>
    <li>Not in the waste of many idle words</li>
    <li>Car’d he to be heard talk, nor in the float</li>
    <li class="number">Of fond conceit, such as this age affords,</li>
    <li>By vain discourse upon himself to dote;</li>
    <li>For his becoming silence gave such grace</li>
    <li>To his judicious parts, as what he spake</li>
    <li>Seem’d rather answers which the wise embrace</li>
    <li class="number">Than busy questions such as talkers make.</li>
    <li>And though his qualities might well deserve</li>
    <li>Just commendation, yet his furnish’d mind</li>
    <li>Such harmony of goodness did preserve</li>
    <li>As nature never built in better kind;</li>
    <li class="number">Knowing the best, and therefore not presuming</li>
    <li>In knowing, but for that it was the best,</li>
    <li>Ever within himself free choice resuming</li>
    <li>Of true perfection, in a perfect breast;</li>
    <li>So that his mind and body made an inn,</li>
    <li class="number">The one to lodge the other, both like fram’d</li>
    <li>For fair conditions, guests that soonest win</li>
    <li>Applause; in generality, well fam’d,</li>
    <li>If trim behavior, gestures mild, discreet</li>
    <li>Endeavors, modest speech, beseeming mirth,</li>
    <li class="number">True friendship, active grace, persuasion sweet,</li>
    <li>Delightful love innated from his birth,</li>
    <li>Acquaintance unfamiliar, carriage just,</li>
    <li>Offenseless resolution, wish’d sobriety,</li>
    <li>Clean-temper’d moderation, steady trust,</li>
    <li class="number">Unburthen’d conscience, unfeign’d piety;</li>
    <li>If these, or all of these, knit fast in one</li>
    <li>Can merit praise, then justly may we say,</li>
    <li>Not any from this frailer stage is gone</li>
    <li>Whose name is like to live a longer day—</li>
    <li class="number">Though not in eminent courts or places great</li>
    <li>For popular concourse, yet in that soil</li>
    <li>Where he enjoy’d his birth, life, death, and seat</li>
    <li>Which now sits mourning his untimely spoil. A</li>
    <li>nd as much glory is it to be good</li>
    <li class="number">For private persons, in their private home,</li>
    <li>As those descended from illustrious blood</li>
    <li>In public view of greatness, whence they come.</li>
    <li>Though I, rewarded with some sadder taste</li>
    <li>Of knowing shame, by feeling it have prov’d</li>
    <li class="number">My country’s thankless misconstruction cast</li>
    <li>Upon my name and credit, both unlov’d</li>
    <li>By some whose fortunes, sunk into the wane</li>
    <li>Of plenty and desert, have strove to win</li>
    <li>Justice by wrong, and sifted to embane</li>
    <li class="number">My reputation with a witless sin;</li>
    <li>Yet time, the father of unblushing truth,</li>
    <li>May one day lay ope malice which hath cross’d it,</li>
    <li>And right the hopes of my endangered youth,</li>
    <li>Purchasing credit in the place I lost it.</li>
    <li class="number">Even in which place the subject of the verse</li>
    <li>(Unhappy matter of a mourning style</li>
    <li>Which now that subject’s merits doth rehearse)</li>
    <li>Had education and new being; while</li>
    <li>By fair demeanor he had won repute</li>
    <li class="number">Amongst the all of all that lived there,</li>
    <li>For that his actions did so wholly suit</li>
    <li>With worthiness, still memorable here.</li>
    <li>The many hours till the day of doom</li>
    <li>Will not consume his life and hapless end,</li>
    <li class="number">For should he lie obscur’d without a tomb,</li>
    <li>Time would to time his honesty commend;</li>
    <li>Whiles parents to their children will make known,</li>
    <li>And they to their posterity impart,</li>
    <li>How such a man was sadly overthrown</li>
    <li class="number">By a hand guided by a cruel heart,</li>
    <li>Whereof as many as shall hear that sadness</li>
    <li>Will blame the one’s hard fate, the other’s madness;</li>
    <li>Whiles such as do recount that tale of woe,</li>
    <li>Told by remembrance of the wisest heads,</li>
    <li class="number">Will in the end conclude the matter so,</li>
    <li>As they will all go weeping to their beds.</li>
    <li>For when the world lies winter’d in the storms</li>
    <li>Of fearful consummation, and lays down</li>
    <li>Th’ unsteady change of his fantastic forms,</li>
    <li class="number">Expecting ever to be overthrown;</li>
    <li>When the proud height of much affected sin</li>
    <li>Shall ripen to a head, and in that pride</li>
    <li>End in the miseries it did begin</li>
    <li>And fall amidst the glory of his tide;</li>
    <li class="number">Then in a book where every work is writ</li>
    <li>Shall this man’s actions be reveal’d, to show</li>
    <li>The gainful fruit of well-employed wit,</li>
    <li>Which paid to heaven the debt that it did owe.</li>
    <li>Here shall be reckon’d up the constant faith,</li>
    <li class="number">Never untrue, where once he love profess’d;</li>
    <li>Which is a miracle in men, one saith,</li>
    <li>Long sought though rarely found, and he is best</li>
    <li>Who can make friendship, in those times of change,</li>
    <li>Admired more for being firm than strange.</li>
    <li class="number">When those weak houses of our brittle flesh</li>
    <li>Shall ruin’d be by death, our grace and strength,</li>
    <li>Youth, memory and shape that made us fresh</li>
    <li>Cast down, and utterly decay’d at length;</li>
    <li>When all shall turn to dust from whence we came</li>
    <li class="number">And we low-level’d in a narrow grave,</li>
    <li>What can we leave behind us but a name,</li>
    <li>Which, by a life well led, may honor have?</li>
    <li>Such honor, O thou youth untimely lost,</li>
    <li>Thou didst deserve and hast; for though thy soul</li>
    <li class="number">Hath took her flight to a diviner coast,</li>
    <li>Yet here on earth thy fame lives ever whole,</li>
    <li>In every heart seal’d up, in every tongue</li>
    <li>Fit matter to discourse, no day prevented</li>
    <li>That pities not thy sad and sudden wrong,</li>
    <li class="number">Of all alike beloved and lamented.</li>
    <li>And I here to thy memorable worth,</li>
    <li>In this last act of friendship, sacrifice</li>
    <li>My love to thee, which I could not set forth</li>
    <li>In any other habit of disguise.</li>
    <li class="number">Although I could not learn, whiles yet thou wert,</li>
    <li>To speak the language of a servile breath,</li>
    <li>My truth stole from my tongue into my heart,</li>
    <li>Which shall not thence be sund’red, but in death.</li>
    <li>And I confess my love was too remiss</li>
    <li class="number">That had not made thee know how much I priz’d thee,</li>
    <li>But that mine error was, as yet it is,</li>
    <li>To think love best in silence: for I siz’d thee</li>
    <li>By what I would have been, not only ready</li>
    <li>In telling I was thine, but being so,</li>
    <li class="number">By some effect to show it. He is steady</li>
    <li>Who seems less than he is in open show.</li>
    <li>Since then I still reserv’d to try the worst</li>
    <li>Which hardest fate and time thus can lay on me.</li>
    <li>T’ enlarge my thoughts was hindered at first,</li>
    <li class="number">While thou hadst life; I took this task upon me,</li>
    <li>To register with mine unhappy pen</li>
    <li>Such duties as it owes to thy desert,</li>
    <li>And set thee as a president to men,</li>
    <li>And limn thee to the world but as thou wert—</li>
    <li class="number">Not hir’d, as heaven can witness in my soul,</li>
    <li>By vain conceit, to please such ones as know it,</li>
    <li>Nor servile to be lik’d, free from control,</li>
    <li>Which, pain to many men, I do not owe it.</li>
    <li>But here I trust I have discharged now</li>
    <li class="number">(Fair lovely branch too soon cut off) to thee,</li>
    <li>My constant and irrefragable vow,</li>
    <li>As, had it chanc’d, thou mightst have done to me—</li>
    <li>But that no merit strong enough of mine</li>
    <li>Had yielded store to thy well-abled quill</li>
    <li class="number">Whereby t’enroll my name, as this of thine,</li>
    <li>How s’ere enriched by thy plenteous skill.</li>
    <li>Here, then, I offer up to memory</li>
    <li>The value of my talent, precious man,</li>
    <li>Whereby if thou live to posterity,</li>
    <li class="number">Though’t be not as I would, ’tis as I can:</li>
    <li>In minds from whence endeavor doth proceed,</li>
    <li>A ready will is taken for the deed.</li>
    <li>Yet ere I take my longest last farewell</li>
    <li>From thee, fair mark of sorrow, let me frame</li>
    <li class="number">Some ampler work of thank, wherein to tell</li>
    <li>What more thou didst deserve than in thy name,</li>
    <li>And free thee from the scandal of such senses</li>
    <li>As in the rancor of unhappy spleen</li>
    <li>Measure thy course of life, with false pretenses</li>
    <li class="number">Comparing by thy death what thou hast been.</li>
    <li>So in his mischiefs is the world accurs’d:</li>
    <li>It picks out matter to inform the worst.</li>
    <li>The willful blindness that hoodwinks the eyes</li>
    <li>Of men enwrapped in an earthy veil</li>
    <li class="number">Makes them most ignorantly exercise</li>
    <li>And yield to humor when it doth assail,</li>
    <li>Whereby the candle and the body’s light</li>
    <li>Darkens the inward eyesight of the mind,</li>
    <li>Presuming still it sees, even in the night</li>
    <li class="number">Of that same ignorance which makes them blind.</li>
    <li>Hence conster they with corrupt commentaries,</li>
    <li>Proceeding from a nature as corrupt,</li>
    <li>The text of malice, which so often varies</li>
    <li>As ’tis by seeming reason underpropp’d.</li>
    <li class="number">O, whither tends the lamentable spite</li>
    <li>Of this world’s teenful apprehension,</li>
    <li>Which understands all things amiss, whose light</li>
    <li>Shines not amidst the dark of their dissension?</li>
    <li>True ’tis, this man, whiles yet he was a man,</li>
    <li class="number">Sooth’d not the current of besotted fashion,</li>
    <li>Nor could digest, as some loose mimics can,</li>
    <li>An empty sound of overweening passion,</li>
    <li>So much to be made servant to the base</li>
    <li>And sensual aptness of disunion’d vices,</li>
    <li class="number">To purchase commendation by disgrace,</li>
    <li>Whereto the world and heat of sin entices.</li>
    <li>But in a safer contemplation,</li>
    <li>Secure in what he knew, he ever chose</li>
    <li>The ready way to commendation,</li>
    <li class="number">By shunning all invitements strange, of those</li>
    <li>Whose illness is, the necessary praise</li>
    <li>Must wait upon their actions; only rare</li>
    <li>In being rare in shame (which strives to raise</li>
    <li>Their name by doing what they do not care),</li>
    <li class="number">As if the free commission of their ill</li>
    <li>Were even as boundless as their prompt desires;</li>
    <li>Only like lords, like subjects to their will,</li>
    <li>Which their fond dotage ever more admires.</li>
    <li>He was not so: but in a serious awe,</li>
    <li class="number">Ruling the little ordered commonwealth</li>
    <li>Of his own self, with honor to the law</li>
    <li>That gave peace to his bread, bread to his health;</li>
    <li>Which ever he maintain’d in sweet content</li>
    <li>And pleasurable rest, wherein he joy’d</li>
    <li class="number">A monarchy of comfort’s government,</li>
    <li>Never until his last to be destroy’d.</li>
    <li>For in the Vineyard of heaven-favored learning</li>
    <li>Where he was double-honor’d in degree,</li>
    <li>His observation and discreet discerning</li>
    <li class="number">Had taught him in both fortunes to be free;</li>
    <li>Whence now retir’d home, to a home indeed</li>
    <li>The home of his condition and estate,</li>
    <li>He well provided ’gainst the hand of need,</li>
    <li>Whence young men sometime grow unfortunate;</li>
    <li class="number">His disposition, by the bonds of unity,</li>
    <li>So fast’ned to his reason that it strove</li>
    <li>With understanding’s grave immunity</li>
    <li>To purchase from all hearts a steady love;</li>
    <li>Wherein not any one thing comprehends</li>
    <li class="number">Proportionable note of what he was,</li>
    <li>Than that he was so constant to his friends</li>
    <li>As he would no occasion overpass</li>
    <li>Which might make known his unaffected care,</li>
    <li>In all respects of trial, to unlock</li>
    <li class="number">His bosom and his store, which did declare</li>
    <li>That Christ was his, and he was Friendship’s Rock:</li>
    <li>A Rock of Friendship figured in his name,</li>
    <li>Fore-shewing what he was, and what should be,</li>
    <li>Most true presage; and he discharg’d the same</li>
    <li class="number">In every act of perfect amity—</li>
    <li>Though in the complemental phrase of words</li>
    <li>He never was addicted to the vain</li>
    <li>Of boast, such as the common breath affords;</li>
    <li>He was in use most fast, in tongue most plain,</li>
    <li class="number">Nor amongst all those virtues that forever</li>
    <li>Adorn’d his reputation will be found</li>
    <li>One greater than his Faith, which did persever,</li>
    <li>Where once it was protested, alway sound.</li>
    <li>Hence sprung the deadly fuel that reviv’d</li>
    <li class="number">The rage which wrought his end, for had he been</li>
    <li>Slacker in love, he had been longer liv’d</li>
    <li>And not oppress’d by wrath’s unhappy sin—</li>
    <li>By wrath’s unhappy sin, which unadvis’d</li>
    <li>Gave death for free good will, and wounds for love.</li>
    <li class="number">Pity it was that blood had not been priz’d</li>
    <li>At higher rate, and reason set above</li>
    <li>Most unjust choler, which untimely</li>
    <li>Drew Destruction on itself; and most unjust,</li>
    <li>Robb’d virtue of a follower so true</li>
    <li class="number">As time can boast of, both for love and trust:</li>
    <li>So henceforth all (great glory to his blood)</li>
    <li>Shall be but seconds to him, being good.</li>
    <li>The wicked end their honor with their sin</li>
    <li>In death, which only then the good begin.</li>
    <li class="number">Lo, here a lesson by experience taught</li>
    <li>For men whose pure simplicity hath drawn</li>
    <li>Their trust to be betray’d by being caught</li>
    <li>Within the snares of making truth a pawn;</li>
    <li>Whiles it, not doubting whereinto it enters,</li>
    <li class="number">Without true proof and knowledge of a friend,</li>
    <li>Sincere in singleness of heart, adventers</li>
    <li>To give fit cause, ere love begin to end:</li>
    <li>His unfeign’d friendship where it least was sought,</li>
    <li>Him to a fatal timeless ruin brought;</li>
    <li class="number">Whereby the life that purity adorn’d</li>
    <li>With real merit, by this sudden end</li>
    <li>Is in the mouth of some in manner scorn’d,</li>
    <li>Made questionable, for they do intend,</li>
    <li>According to the tenor of the saw</li>
    <li class="number">Mistook, if not observ’d (writ long ago</li>
    <li>When men were only led by Reason’s law),</li>
    <li>That "Such as is the end, the life proves so."</li>
    <li>Thus he, who to the universal lapse</li>
    <li>Gave sweet redemption, off’ring up his blood</li>
    <li class="number">To conquer death by death, and loose the traps</li>
    <li>Of hell, even in the triumph that it stood:</li>
    <li>He thus, for that his guiltless life was spilt</li>
    <li>By death, which was made subject to the curse,</li>
    <li>Might in like manner be reprov’d of guilt</li>
    <li class="number">In his pure life, for that his end was worse.</li>
    <li>But O far be it, our unholy lips</li>
    <li>Should so profane the deity above</li>
    <li>As thereby to ordain revenging whips</li>
    <li>Against the day of Judgment and of Love.</li>
    <li class="number">The hand that lends us honor in our days</li>
    <li>May shorten when it please, and justly take</li>
    <li>Our honor from us many sundry ways,</li>
    <li>As best becomes that wisdom did us make.</li>
    <li>The second brother, who was next begot</li>
    <li class="number">Of all that ever were begotten yet,</li>
    <li>Was by a hand in vengeance rude and hot</li>
    <li>Sent innocent to be in heaven set—</li>
    <li>Whose fame the angels in melodious choirs</li>
    <li>Still witness to the world. Then why should he,</li>
    <li class="number">Well-profited in excellent desires,</li>
    <li>Be more rebuk’d, who had like destiny?</li>
    <li>Those saints before the everlasting throne</li>
    <li>Who sit with crowns of glory on their heads,</li>
    <li>Wash’d white in blood, from earth hence have not gone</li>
    <li class="number">All to their joys in quiet on their beds,</li>
    <li>But tasted of the sour-bitter scourge</li>
    <li>Of torture and affliction ere they gained</li>
    <li>Those blessings which their sufferance did urge,</li>
    <li>Whereby the grace fore-promis’d they attained.</li>
    <li class="number">Let then the false suggestions of the froward,</li>
    <li>Building large castles in the empty air,</li>
    <li>By suppositions fond and thoughts untoward</li>
    <li>(Issues of discontent and sick despair)</li>
    <li>Rebound gross arguments upon their heart</li>
    <li class="number">That may disprove their malice, and confound</li>
    <li>Uncivil loose opinions which insert</li>
    <li>Their souls into the roll that doth unsound</li>
    <li>Betraying policies, and show their brains,</li>
    <li>Unto their shame, ridiculous; whose scope</li>
    <li class="number">Is envy, whose endeavors fruitless pains,</li>
    <li>In nothing surely prosperous, but hope—</li>
    <li>And that same hope, so lame, so unprevailing,</li>
    <li>It buries self-conceit in weak opinion;</li>
    <li>Which being cross’d, gives matter of bewailing</li>
    <li class="number">Their vain designs, on whom want hath dominion.</li>
    <li>Such, and of such condition, may devise</li>
    <li>Which way to wound with defamation’s spirit</li>
    <li>(Close-lurking whisper’s hidden forgeries)</li>
    <li>His taintless goodness, his desertful merit.</li>
    <li class="number">But whiles the minds of men can judge sincerely,</li>
    <li>Upon assured knowledge, his repute</li>
    <li>And estimation shall be rumor’d clearly</li>
    <li>In equal worth—time shall to time renew ’t.</li>
    <li>The Grave-that in his ever-empty womb</li>
    <li class="number">Forever closes up the unrespected</li>
    <li>Who, when they die, die all—shall not entomb</li>
    <li>His pleading best perfections as neglected.</li>
    <li>They to his notice in succeeding years</li>
    <li>Shall speak for him when he shall lie below;</li>
    <li class="number">When nothing but his memory appears</li>
    <li>Of what he was, then shall his virtues grow.</li>
    <li>His being but a private man in rank</li>
    <li>(And yet not rank’d beneath a gentleman)</li>
    <li>Shall not abridge the commendable thank</li>
    <li class="number">Which wise posterity shall give him then;</li>
    <li>For Nature, and his therein happy Fate.</li>
    <li>Ordain’d that by his quality of mind</li>
    <li>T’ ennoble that best part, although his state</li>
    <li>Were to a lower blessedness confin’d.</li>
    <li class="number">Blood, pomp, state, honor, glory and command,</li>
    <li>Without fit ornaments of disposition,</li>
    <li>Are in themselves but heathenish and profane,</li>
    <li>And much more peaceful is a mean condition</li>
    <li>Which, underneath the roof of safe content,</li>
    <li class="number">Feeds on the bread of rest, and takes delight</li>
    <li>To look upon the labors it hath spent</li>
    <li>For its own sustenance, both day and night;</li>
    <li>Whiles others, plotting which way to be great,</li>
    <li>How to augment their portion and ambition,</li>
    <li class="number">Do toil their giddy brains, and ever sweat</li>
    <li>For popular applause and power’s commission.</li>
    <li>But one in honors, like a sealed dove</li>
    <li>Whose inward eyes are dimm’d with dignity,</li>
    <li>Does think most safety doth remain above,</li>
    <li class="number">And seeks to be secure by mounting high:</li>
    <li>Whence, when he falls, who did erewhile aspire,</li>
    <li>Falls deeper down, for that he climbed higher.</li>
    <li>Now men who in a lower region live</li>
    <li>Exempt from danger of authority</li>
    <li class="number">Have fittest times in Reason’s rules to thrive,</li>
    <li>Not vex’d with envy of priority,</li>
    <li>And those are much more noble in the mind</li>
    <li>Than many that have nobleness by kind.</li>
    <li>Birth, blood, and ancestors, are none of ours,</li>
    <li class="number">Nor can we make a proper challenge to them,</li>
    <li>But virtues and perfections in our powers</li>
    <li>Proceed most truly from us, if we do them.</li>
    <li>Respective titles or a gracious style,</li>
    <li>With all what men in eminence possess,</li>
    <li class="number">Are, without ornaments to praise them, vile:</li>
    <li>The beauty of the mind is nobleness.</li>
    <li>And such as have that beauty, well deserve</li>
    <li>Eternal characters, that after death</li>
    <li>Remembrance of their worth we may preserve,</li>
    <li class="number">So that their glory die not with their breath.</li>
    <li>Else what avails it in a goodly strife</li>
    <li>Upon this face of earth here to contend,</li>
    <li>The good t’exceed the wicked in their life,</li>
    <li>Should both be like obscured in their end?</li>
    <li class="number">Until which end, there is none rightly can</li>
    <li>Be termed happy, since the happiness</li>
    <li>Depends upon the goodness of the man,</li>
    <li>Which afterwards his praises will express.</li>
    <li>Look hither then, you that enjoy the youth</li>
    <li class="number">Of your best days, and see how unexpected</li>
    <li>Death can betray your jollity to ruth</li>
    <li>When death you think is least to be respected!</li>
    <li>The person of this model here set out</li>
    <li>Had all that youth and happy days could give him,</li>
    <li class="number">Yet could not all-encompass him about</li>
    <li>Against th’assault of death, who to relieve him</li>
    <li>Struck home but to the frail and mortal parts</li>
    <li>Of his humanity, but could not touch</li>
    <li>His flourishing and fair long-liv’d deserts,</li>
    <li class="number">Above fate’s reach, his singleness was such—</li>
    <li>So that he dies but once, but doubly lives,</li>
    <li>Once in his proper self, then in his name;</li>
    <li>Predestinated Time, who all deprives,</li>
    <li>Could never yet deprive him of the same.</li>
    <li class="number">And had the Genius which attended on him</li>
    <li>Been possibilited to keep him safe</li>
    <li>Against the rigor that hath overgone him,</li>
    <li>He had been to the public use a staff,</li>
    <li>Leading by his example in the path</li>
    <li class="number">Which guides to doing well, wherein so few</li>
    <li>The proneness of this age to error hath</li>
    <li>Informed rightly in the courses true.</li>
    <li>As then the loss of one, whose inclination</li>
    <li>Strove to win love in general, is sad,</li>
    <li class="number">So specially his friends, in soft compassion</li>
    <li>Do feel the greatest loss they could have had.</li>
    <li>Amongst them all, she who those nine of years</li>
    <li>Liv’d fellow to his counsels and his bed</li>
    <li>Hath the most share in loss: for I in hers</li>
    <li class="number">Feel what distemperature this chance hath bred.</li>
    <li>The chaste embracements of conjugal love,</li>
    <li>Who in a mutual harmony consent,</li>
    <li>Are so impatient of a strange remove</li>
    <li>As meager death itself seems to lament,</li>
    <li class="number">And weep upon those cheeks which nature fram’d</li>
    <li>To be delightful orbs in whom the force</li>
    <li>Of lively sweetness plays, so that asham’d</li>
    <li>Death often pities his unkind divorce.</li>
    <li>Such was the separation here constrain’d</li>
    <li class="number">(Well-worthy to be termed a rudeness rather),</li>
    <li>For in his life his love was so unfeign’d</li>
    <li>As he was both an husband and a father—</li>
    <li>The one in firm affection and the other</li>
    <li>In careful providence, which ever strove</li>
    <li class="number">With joint assistance to grace one another</li>
    <li>With every helpful furtherance of love.</li>
    <li>But since the sum of all that can be said</li>
    <li>Can be but said that "He was good"</li>
    <li>(which wholly Includes all excellence can be display’d</li>
    <li class="number">In praise of virtue and reproach of folly).</li>
    <li>His due deserts, this sentence on him gives,</li>
    <li>"He died in life, yet in his death he lives."</li>
    <li>Now runs the method of this doleful song</li>
    <li>In accents brief to thee, O thou deceas’d!</li>
    <li class="number">To whom those pains do only all belong</li>
    <li>As witnesses I did not love thee least.</li>
    <li>For could my worthless brain find out but how</li>
    <li>To raise thee from the sepulcher of dust,</li>
    <li>Undoubtedly thou shouldst have partage now</li>
    <li class="number">Of life with me, and heaven be counted just</li>
    <li>If to a supplicating soul it would</li>
    <li>Give life anew, by giving life again</li>
    <li>Where life is miss’d; whereby discomfort should</li>
    <li>Right his old griefs, and former joys retain</li>
    <li class="number">Which now with thee are leap’d into thy tomb</li>
    <li>And buried in that hollow vault of woe,</li>
    <li>Expecting yet a more severer doom</li>
    <li>Than time’s strict flinty hand will let ’em know.</li>
    <li>And now if I have level’d mine account</li>
    <li class="number">And reckon’d up in a true measured score</li>
    <li>Those perfect graces which were ever wont</li>
    <li>To wait on thee alive, I ask no more</li>
    <li>(But shall hereafter in a poor content</li>
    <li>Immure those imputations I sustain,</li>
    <li class="number">Learning my days of youth so to prevent</li>
    <li>As not to be cast down by them again)—</li>
    <li>Only those hopes which fate denies to grant</li>
    <li>In full possession to a captive heart</li>
    <li>Who, if it were in plenty, still would want</li>
    <li class="number">Before it may enjoy his better part;</li>
    <li>From which detain’d, and banish’d in th’ exile</li>
    <li>Of dim misfortune, has none other prop</li>
    <li>Whereon to lean and rest itself the while</li>
    <li>But the weak comfort of the hapless, Hope.</li>
    <li class="number">And Hope must in despite of fearful change</li>
    <li>Play in the strongest closet of my breast,</li>
    <li>Although perhaps I ignorantly range</li>
    <li>And court opinion in my deep’st unrest.</li>
    <li>But whether doth the stream of my mischance</li>
    <li class="number">Drive me beyond myself, fast friend, soon lost,</li>
    <li>Long may thy worthiness thy name advance</li>
    <li>Amongst the virtuous and deserving most,</li>
    <li>Who herein hast forever happy prov’d:</li>
    <li>In life thou liv’dst, in death thou died’st belov’d.</li>
