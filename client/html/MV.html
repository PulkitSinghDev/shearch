  <li class="number">In sooth, I know not why I am so sad;</li>
  <li class="number">It wearies me, you say it wearies you;</li>
  <li class="number">But how I caught it, found it, or came by it,</li>
  <li class="number">What stuff ’tis made of, whereof it is born,</li>
  <li class="number">I am to learn;</li>
  <li class="number">And such a want-wit sadness makes of me,</li>
  <li class="number">That I have much ado to know myself.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SAL.">
  <li class="number">Your mind is tossing on the ocean,</li>
  <li class="number">There where your argosies with portly sail</li>
  <li class="number">Like <foreign xml:lang="it">signior</foreign>s and rich burghers on the flood,</li>
  <li class="number">Or as it were the pageants of the sea,</li>
  <li class="number">Do overpeer the petty traffickers</li>
  <li class="number">That cur’sy to them, do them reverence,</li>
  <li class="number">As they fly by them with their woven wings.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SOL.">
  <li class="number">Believe me, sir, had I such venture forth,</li>
  <li class="number">The better part of my affections would</li>
  <li class="number">Be with my hopes abroad. I should be still</li>
  <li class="number">Plucking the grass to know where sits the wind,</li>
  <li class="number">Piring in maps for ports and piers and roads;</li>
  <li class="number">And every object that might make me fear</li>
  <li class="number">Misfortune to my ventures, out of doubt</li>
  <li class="number">Would make me sad.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SAL.">
  <li class="number">My wind cooling my broth</li>
  <li class="number">Would blow me to an ague when I thought</li>
  <li class="number">What harm a wind too great might do at sea.</li>
  <li class="number">I should not see the sandy hour-glass run</li>
  <li class="number">But I should think of shallows and of flats,</li>
  <li class="number">And see my wealthy Andrew dock’d in sand,</li>
  <li class="number">Vailing her high top lower than her ribs</li>
  <li class="number">To kiss her burial. Should I go to church</li>
  <li class="number">And see the holy edifice of stone,</li>
  <li class="number">And not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks,</li>
  <li class="number">Which touching but my gentle vessel’s side</li>
  <li class="number">Would scatter all her spices on the stream,</li>
  <li class="number">Enrobe the roaring waters with my silks,</li>
  <li class="number">And in a word, but even now worth this,</li>
  <li class="number">And now worth nothing? Shall I have the thought</li>
  <li class="number">To think on this, and shall I lack the thought</li>
  <li class="number">That such a thing bechanc’d would make me sad?</li>
  <li class="number">But tell not me; I know Antonio</li>
  <li class="number">Is sad to think upon his merchandise.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANT.">
  <li class="number">Believe me, no. I thank my fortune for it,</li>
  <li class="number">My ventures are not in one bottom trusted,</li>
  <li class="number">Nor to one place; nor is my whole estate</li>
  <li class="number">Upon the fortune of this present year:</li>
  <li class="number">Therefore my merchandise makes me not sad.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SOL.">
  <li class="number">Why then you are in love.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANT.">
  <li class="number">Fie, fie!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SOL.">
  <li class="number">Not in love neither? Then let us say you are sad</li>
  <li class="number">Because you are not merry; and ’twere as easy</li>
  <li class="number">For you to laugh and leap, and say you are merry</li>
  <li class="number">Because you are not sad. Now by two-headed Janus,</li>
  <li class="number">Nature hath fram’d strange fellows in her time:</li>
  <li class="number">Some that will evermore peep through their eyes,</li>
  <li class="number">And laugh like parrots at a bagpiper;</li>
  <li class="number">And other of such vinegar aspect</li>
  <li class="number">That they’ll not show their teeth in way of smile</li>
  <li class="number">Though Nestor swear the jest be laughable.</li>

<ol data-speaker="SAL.">

  <li class="number">Good <foreign xml:lang="it">signior</foreign>s both, when shall we laugh? Say, when?</li>

  <li class="number">My Lord Bassanio, since you have found Antonio,</li>
  <li class="number">We two will leave you, but at dinner-time</li>
  <li class="number">I pray you have in mind where we must meet.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BASS.">
  <li class="number">I will not fail you.</li>

<ol data-speaker="GRA.">
  <li class="number">You look not well, <foreign xml:lang="it">Signior</foreign> Antonio,</li>
  <li class="number">You have too much respect upon the world.</li>
  <li class="number">They lose it that do buy it with much care.</li>
  <li class="number">Believe me you are marvelously chang’d.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANT.">
  <li class="number">I hold the world but as the world, Gratiano,</li>
  <li class="number">A stage, where every man must play a part,</li>
  <li class="number">And mine a sad one.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GRA.">
  <li class="number">Let me play the fool,</li>
  <li class="number">With mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come,</li>
  <li class="number">And let my liver rather heat with wine</li>
  <li class="number">Than my heart cool with mortifying groans.</li>
  <li class="number">Why should a man, whose blood is warm within,</li>
  <li class="number">Sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster?</li>
  <li class="number">Sleep when he wakes? And creep into the jaundies</li>
  <li class="number">By being peevish? I tell thee what, Antonio—</li>
  <li class="number">I love thee, and ’tis my love that speaks—</li>
  <li class="number">There are a sort of men whose visages</li>
  <li class="number">Do cream and mantle like a standing pond,</li>
  <li class="number">And do a willful stillness entertain,</li>
  <li class="number">With purpose to be dress’d in an opinion</li>
  <li class="number">Of wisdom, gravity, profound conceit,</li>
  <li class="number">As who should say, “I am Sir Oracle,</li>
  <li class="number">And when I ope my lips let no dog bark!”</li>
  <li class="number">O my Antonio, I do know of these</li>
  <li class="number">That therefore only are reputed wise</li>
  <li class="number">For saying nothing; when I am very sure</li>
  <li class="number">If they should speak, would almost damn those ears</li>
  <li class="number">Which hearing them would call their brothers fools.</li>
  <li class="number">I’ll tell thee more of this another time;</li>
  <li class="number">But fish not with this melancholy bait</li>
  <li class="number">For this fool gudgeon, this opinion.</li>
  <li class="number">Come, good Lorenzo. Fare ye well a while,</li>
  <li class="number">I’ll end my exhortation after dinner.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LOR.">
  <li class="number">Well, we will leave you then till dinner-time.</li>
  <li class="number">I must be one of these same dumb wise men,</li>
  <li class="number">For Gratiano never lets me speak.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GRA.">
  <li class="number">Well, keep me company but two years more,</li>
  <li class="number">Thou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANT.">
  <li class="number">Fare you well! I’ll grow a talker for this gear.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GRA.">
  <li class="number">Thanks, i’ faith, for silence is only commendable</li>

<ol data-speaker="ANT.">
  <li class="number">It is that—any thing now!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BASS.">
  <li class="number">Gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing, more than any man in all Venice. His reasons are as two grains of wheat hid in two bushels of chaff; you shall seek all day ere you find them, and when you have them, they are not worth the search.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANT.">
  <li class="number">Well, tell me now what lady is the same</li>
  <li class="number">To whom you swore a secret pilgrimage,</li>
  <li class="number">That you today promis’d to tell me of?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BASS.">
  <li class="number">’Tis not unknown to you, Antonio,</li>
  <li class="number">How much I have disabled mine estate,</li>
  <li class="number">By something showing a more swelling port</li>
  <li class="number">Than my faint means would grant continuance.</li>
  <li class="number">Nor do I now make moan to be abridg’d</li>
  <li class="number">From such a noble rate, but my chief care</li>
  <li class="number">Is to come fairly off from the great debts</li>
  <li class="number">Wherein my time something too prodigal</li>
  <li class="number">Hath left me gag’d. To you, Antonio,</li>
  <li class="number">I owe the most in money and in love,</li>
  <li class="number">And from your love I have a warranty</li>
  <li class="number">To unburden all my plots and purposes</li>
  <li class="number">How to get clear of all the debts I owe.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANT.">
  <li class="number">I pray you, good Bassanio, let me know it,</li>
  <li class="number">And if it stand, as you yourself still do,</li>
  <li class="number">Within the eye of honor, be assur’d</li>
  <li class="number">My purse, my person, my extremest means,</li>
  <li class="number">Lie all unlock’d to your occasions.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BASS.">
  <li class="number">In my school-days, when I had lost one shaft,</li>
  <li class="number">I shot his fellow of the self-same flight</li>
  <li class="number">The self-same way with more advised watch</li>
  <li class="number">To find the other forth, and by adventuring both</li>
  <li class="number">I oft found both. I urge this childhood proof,</li>
  <li class="number">Because what follows is pure innocence.</li>
  <li class="number">I owe you much, and like a willful youth,</li>
  <li class="number">That which I owe is lost, but if you please</li>
  <li class="number">To shoot another arrow that self way</li>
  <li class="number">Which you did shoot the first, I do not doubt,</li>
  <li class="number">As I will watch the aim, or to find both</li>
  <li class="number">Or bring your latter hazard back again,</li>
  <li class="number">And thankfully rest debtor for the first.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANT.">
  <li class="number">You know me well, and herein spend but time</li>
  <li class="number">To wind about my love with circumstance,</li>
  <li class="number">And out of doubt you do me now more wrong</li>
  <li class="number">In making question of my uttermost</li>
  <li class="number">Than if you had made waste of all I have.</li>
  <li class="number">Then do but say to me what I should do</li>
  <li class="number">That in your knowledge may by me be done,</li>
  <li class="number">And I am prest unto it; therefore speak.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BASS.">
  <li class="number">In Belmont is a lady richly left,</li>
  <li class="number">And she is fair and, fairer than that word,</li>
  <li class="number">Of wondrous virtues. Sometimes from her eyes</li>
  <li class="number">I did receive fair speechless messages.</li>
  <li class="number">Her name is Portia, nothing undervalu’d</li>
  <li class="number">To Cato’s daughter, Brutus’ Portia.</li>
  <li class="number">Nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth,</li>
  <li class="number">For the four winds blow in from every coast</li>
  <li class="number">Renowned suitors, and her sunny locks</li>
  <li class="number">Hang on her temples like a golden fleece,</li>
  <li class="number">Which makes her seat of Belmont Colchis’ strond,</li>
  <li class="number">And many Jasons come in quest of her.</li>
  <li class="number">O my Antonio, had I but the means</li>
  <li class="number">To hold a rival place with one of them,</li>
  <li class="number">I have a mind presages me such thrift</li>
  <li class="number">That I should questionless be fortunate!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANT.">
  <li class="number">Thou know’st that all my fortunes are at sea,</li>
  <li class="number">Neither have I money nor commodity</li>
  <li class="number">To raise a present sum; therefore go forth,</li>
  <li class="number">Try what my credit can in Venice do.</li>
  <li class="number">That shall be rack’d, even to the uttermost,</li>
  <li class="number">To furnish thee to Belmont, to fair Portia.</li>
  <li class="number">Go presently inquire, and so will I,</li>
  <li class="number">Where money is, and I no question make</li>
  <li class="number">To have it of my trust, or for my sake.</li>

<h3>Scene 2</h3>

<h4>Belmont. A room in Portia’s house.</h4>

<div class="stage-direction">
	Enter Portia with her waiting-woman, Nerissa.
	
		POR.
		NER.
	
</div>

<ol data-speaker="POR.">
  <li class="number">By my troth, Nerissa, my little body is a-weary of this great world.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NER.">
  <li class="number">You would be, sweet madam, if your miseries were in the same abundance as your good fortunes are; and yet for aught I see, they are as sick that surfeit with too much as they that starve with nothing. It is no mean happiness therefore to be seated in the mean: superfluity comes sooner by white hairs, but competency lives longer.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POR.">
  <li class="number">Good sentences, and well pronounc’d.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NER.">
  <li class="number">They would be better if well follow’d.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POR.">
  <li class="number">If to do were as easy as to know what were good to do, chapels had been churches, and poor men’s cottages princes’ palaces. It is a good divine that follows his own instructions; I can easier teach twenty what were good to be done, than to be one of the twenty to follow mine own teaching. The brain may devise laws for the blood, but a hot temper leaps o’er a cold decree—such a hare is madness the youth, to skip o’er the meshes of good counsel the cripple. But this reasoning is not in the fashion to choose me a husband. O me, the word choose! I may neither choose who I would, nor refuse who I dislike; so is the will of a living daughter curb’d by the will of a dead father. Is it not hard, Nerissa, that I cannot choose one, nor refuse none?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NER.">
  <li class="number">Your father was ever virtuous, and holy men at their death have good inspirations; therefore the lott’ry that he hath devis’d 
in these three chests of gold, silver, and lead, whereof who chooses his meaning chooses you, will no doubt never be chosen by any rightly but one who you shall rightly love. 
But what warmth is there in your affection towards any of these princely suitors that are already come?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POR.">
  <li class="number">I pray thee over-name them, and as thou namest them, I will describe them; and according to my description level at my affection.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NER.">
  <li class="number">First, there is the Neapolitan prince.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POR.">
  <li class="number">Ay, that’s a colt indeed, for he doth nothing but talk of his horse, and he makes it a great appropriation to his own good parts 
that he can shoe him himself. I am much afeard my lady his mother play’d false with a smith.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NER.">
  <li class="number">Then is there the County Palentine.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POR.">
  <li class="number">He doth nothing but frown, as who should say, “And you will not have me, choose.” He hears merry tales and smiles not. 
I fear he will prove the weeping philosopher when he grows old, being so full of unmannerly sadness in his youth. 
I had rather be married to a death’s-head with a bone in his mouth than to either of these. God defend me from these two!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NER.">
  <li class="number">How say you by the French lord, <foreign xml:lang="fr">Monsieur</foreign> Le Bon?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POR.">
  <li class="number">God made him, and therefore let him pass for a man. In truth, I know it is a sin to be a mocker, but he! Why, he hath a horse better than the Neapolitan’s, a better bad habit of frowning than the Count Palentine; he is every man in no man. If a throstle sing, he falls straight a-cap’ring. He will fence with his own shadow. If I should marry him, I should marry twenty husbands. If he would despise me, I would forgive him, for if he love me to madness, I shall never requite him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NER.">
  <li class="number">What say you then to Falconbridge, the young baron of England?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POR.">
  <li class="number">You know I say nothing to him, for he understands not me, nor I him. He hath neither Latin, French, nor Italian, and you will come into the court and swear that I have a poor pennyworth in the English. He is a proper man’s picture, but alas, who can converse with a dumb show? How oddly he is suited! I think he bought his doublet in Italy, his round hose in France, his bonnet in Germany, and his behavior every where.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NER.">
  <li class="number">What think you of the Scottish lord, his neighbor?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POR.">
  <li class="number">That he hath a neighborly charity in him, for he borrow’d a box of the ear of the Englishman, and swore he would pay him again when he was able. I think the Frenchman became his surety and seal’d under for another.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NER.">
  <li class="number">How like you the young German, the Duke of Saxony’s nephew?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POR.">
  <li class="number">Very vildly in the morning, when he is sober, and most vildly in the afternoon, when he is drunk. When he is best, he is a little worse than a man, and when he is worst, he is little better than a beast. And the worst fall that ever fell, I hope I shall make shift to go without him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NER.">
  <li class="number">If he should offer to choose, and choose the right casket, you should refuse to perform your father’s will, if you should refuse to accept him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POR.">
  <li class="number">Therefore for fear of the worst, I pray thee set a deep glass of Rhenish wine on the contrary casket, for if the devil be within, and that temptation without, I know he will choose it. I will do any thing, Nerissa, ere I will be married to a sponge.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NER.">
  <li class="number">You need not fear, lady, the having any of these lords. They have acquainted me with their determinations, which is indeed to return to their home, and to trouble you with no more suit, unless you may be won by some other sort than your father’s imposition depending on the caskets.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POR.">
  <li class="number">If I live to be as old as Sibylla, I will die as chaste as Diana, unless I be obtain’d by the manner of my father’s will. 
I am glad this parcel of wooers are so reasonable, for there is not one among them but I dote on his very absence, and I pray God grant them a fair departure.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NER.">
  <li class="number">Do you not remember, lady, in your father’s time, a Venetian, a scholar and a soldier, that came hither in company of the Marquis of Montferrat?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POR.">
  <li class="number">Yes, yes, it was Bassanio—as I think, so was he call’d.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NER.">
  <li class="number">True, madam; he, of all the men that ever my foolish eyes look’d upon, was the best deserving a fair lady.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POR.">
  <li class="number">I remember him well, and I remember him worthy of thy praise.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">
	Enter a Servingman.
	
		SERV.
	
</li>
  <li class="number">How now, what news?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SERV.">
  <li class="number">The four strangers seek for you, madam, to take their leave; and there is a forerunner come from a fift, the Prince of Morocco, who brings word the Prince his master will be here tonight.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POR.">
  <li class="number">If I could bid the fifth welcome with so good heart as I can bid the other four farewell, I should be glad of his approach. If he have the condition of a saint, and the complexion of a devil, I had rather he should shrive me than wive me.</li>
  <li class="number">Come, Nerissa. Sirrah, go before.</li>

<ol data-speaker="SHY.">
  <li class="number">Three thousand ducats, well.</li>

<ol data-speaker="BASS.">
  <li class="number">Ay, sir, for three months.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHY.">
  <li class="number">For three months, well.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BASS.">
  <li class="number">For the which, as I told you, Antonio shall be bound.</li>

<ol data-speaker="BASS.">
  <li class="number">Your answer to that.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHY.">
  <li class="number">Antonio is a good man.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BASS.">
  <li class="number">Have you heard any imputation to the contrary?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHY.">
  <li class="number">Ho, no, no, no, no! My meaning in saying he is a good man is to have you understand me that he is sufficient. Yet his means are in supposition: he hath an argosy bound to Tripolis, another to the Indies; I understand moreover upon the Rialto, he hath a third at Mexico, a fourth for England, and other ventures he hath, squand’red abroad. But ships are but boards, sailors but men; there be land-rats and water-rats, water-thieves and land-thieves, I mean pirates, and then there is the peril of waters, winds, and rocks. The man is notwithstanding sufficient. Three thousand ducats; I think I may take his bond.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BASS.">
  <li class="number">Be assur’d you may.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHY.">
  <li class="number">I will be assur’d I may; and that I may be assur’d, I will bethink me. May I speak with Antonio?</li>

<ol data-speaker="BASS.">
  <li class="number">If it please you to dine with us.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="SHY.">
  <li class="number">Yes, to smell pork, to eat of the habitation which your prophet the Nazarite conjur’d the devil into. I will buy with you, sell with you, talk with you, walk with you, and so following; but I will not eat with you, drink with you, nor pray with you. What news on the Rialto? Who is he comes here?</li>

<h4>Venice. A street.</h4>

</div>

<ol data-speaker="LAUN.">
  <li class="number">Certainly my conscience will serve me to run from this Jew my master. 
The fiend is at mine elbow and tempts me, saying to me, “Gobbo, Launcelot Gobbo, good Launcelot,” or “good Gobbo,” 
or “good Launcelot Gobbo, use your legs, take the start, run away.” My conscience says, “No; take heed, honest Launcelot, take heed, honest Gobbo,” 
or as aforesaid, “honest Launcelot Gobbo, do not run, scorn running with thy heels.” 
Well, the most courageous fiend bids me pack. “Fia!” says the fiend; “away!” says the fiend; “for the heavens, rouse up a brave mind,” says the fiend, “and run.” Well, my conscience, hanging about the neck of my heart, says very wisely to me, “My honest friend Launcelot, being an honest man’s son”—or rather an honest woman’s son, for indeed my father did something smack, something grow to, he had a kind of taste—well, my conscience says, “Launcelot, bouge not.” “Bouge,” says the fiend. “Bouge not,” says my conscience. “Conscience,” say I, “you counsel well.” “Fiend,” say I, “you counsel well.” To be rul’d by my conscience, I should stay with the Jew my master, who (God bless the mark) is a kind of devil; and to run away from the Jew, I should be rul’d by the fiend, who, saving your reverence, is the devil himself. Certainly the Jew is the very devil incarnation, and in my conscience, my conscience is but a kind of hard conscience, to offer to counsel me to stay with the Jew. The fiend gives the more friendly counsel: I will run, fiend; my heels are at your commandment, I will run.</li>

  <li class="number">What if I stray’d no farther, but chose here?</li>
  <li class="number">Let’s see once more this saying grav’d in gold:</li>
  <li class="number">“Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire.”</li>

He hath disgrac’d me, and hind’red me half a million, laugh’d at my losses, mock’d at my gains, scorn’d my nation, thwarted my bargains, cool’d my friends, heated mine enemies; and what’s his reason? I am a Jew. Hath not a Jew eyes? Hath not a Jew hands, organs, dimensions, senses, affections, passions; fed with the same food, hurt with the same weapons, subject to the same diseases, heal’d by the same means, warm’d and cool’d by the same winter and summer, as a Christian is? If you prick us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh? If you poison us, do we not die? And if you wrong us, shall we not revenge? If we are like you in the rest, we will resemble you in that. If a Jew wrong a Christian, what is his humility? Revenge. If a Christian wrong a Jew, what should his sufferance be by Christian example? Why, revenge. The villainy you teach me, I will execute, and it shall go hard but I will better the instruction.</li>

  <li class="number">I thank thee, good Tubal, good news, good news! Ha, ha! Heard in Genoa?</li>

  <li class="number">Your daughter spent in Genoa, as I heard, one night fourscore ducats.</li>

<ol data-speaker="SHY.">
  <li class="number">Out upon her! Thou torturest me, Tubal. It was my turkis, I had it of Leah when I was a bachelor. 
I would not have given it for a wilderness of monkeys.</li>

<ol data-speaker="SHY.">
  <li class="number">Nay, that’s true, that’s very true. Go, Tubal, fee me an officer; bespeak him a fortnight before. I will have the heart of him if he forfeit, for were he out of Venice I can make what merchandise I will. 
Go, Tubal, and meet me at our synagogue; go, good Tubal, at our synagogue, Tubal.</li>

  <li class="number">I pray you tarry, pause a day or two</li>
  <li class="number">Before you hazard, for in choosing wrong</li>
  <li class="number">I lose your company; therefore forbear a while.</li>
  <li class="number">There’s something tells me (but it is not love)</li>
  <li class="number">I would not lose you, and you know yourself,</li>
  <li class="number">Hate counsels not in such a quality.</li>
  <li class="number">But lest you should not understand me well—</li>
  <li class="number">And yet a maiden hath no tongue but thought—</li>
  <li class="number">I would detain you here some month or two</li>
  <li class="number">Before you venture for me. I could teach you</li>
  <li class="number">How to choose right, but then I am forsworn.</li>
  <li class="number">So will I never be, so may you miss me,</li>
  <li class="number">But if you do, you’ll make me wish a sin,</li>
  <li class="number">That I had been forsworn. Beshrew your eyes,</li>
  <li class="number">They have o’erlook’d me and divided me:</li>
  <li class="number">One half of me is yours, the other half yours—</li>
  <li class="number">Mine own, I would say; but if mine, then yours,</li>
  <li class="number">And so all yours. O, these naughty times</li>
  <li class="number">Puts bars between the owners and their rights!</li>
  <li class="number">And so though yours, not yours. Prove it so,</li>
  <li class="number">Let fortune go to hell for it, not I.</li>
  <li class="number">I speak too long, but ’tis to peize the time,</li>
  <li class="number">To eche it, and to draw it out in length,</li>
  <li class="number">To stay you from election.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BASS.">
  <li class="number">Let me choose,</li>

  <li class="number">Upon the rack, Bassanio! Then confess</li>
  <li class="number">What treason there is mingled with your love.</li>

<ol data-speaker="BASS.">
  <li class="number">None but that ugly treason of mistrust,</li>
  <li class="number">Which makes me fear th’ enjoying of my love;</li>
  <li class="number">There may as well be amity and life</li>
  <li class="number">’Tween snow and fire, as treason and my love.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POR.">
  <li class="number">Ay, but I fear you speak upon the rack,</li>
  <li class="number">Where men enforced do speak any thing.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BASS.">
  <li class="number">Promise me life, and I’ll confess the truth.</li>

<ol data-speaker="BASS.">
  <li class="number">Confess and love</li>
  <li class="number">Had been the very sum of my confession.</li>
  <li class="number">O happy torment, when my torturer</li>
  <li class="number">Doth teach me answers for deliverance!</li>
  <li class="number">But let me to my fortune and the caskets.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POR.">
  <li class="number">Away then! I am lock’d in one of them;</li>
  <li class="number">If you do love me, you will find me out.</li>
  <li class="number">Nerissa and the rest, stand all aloof.</li>
  <li class="number">Let music sound while he doth make his choice;</li>
  <li class="number">Then if he lose he makes a swan-like end,</li>
  <li class="number">Fading in music. That the comparison</li>
  <li class="number">May stand more proper, my eye shall be the stream</li>
  <li class="number">And wat’ry death-bed for him. He may win,</li>
  <li class="number">And what is music then? Then music is</li>
  <li class="number">Even as the flourish when true subjects bow</li>
  <li class="number">To a new-crowned monarch; such it is</li>
  <li class="number">As are those dulcet sounds in break of day</li>
  <li class="number">That creep into the dreaming bridegroom’s ear,</li>
  <li class="number">And summon him to marriage. Now he goes,</li>
  <li class="number">With no less presence, but with much more love,</li>
  <li class="number">Than young Alcides, when he did redeem</li>
  <li class="number">The virgin tribute paid by howling Troy</li>
  <li class="number">To the sea-monster. I stand for sacrifice;</li>
  <li class="number">The rest aloof are the Dardanian wives,</li>
  <li class="number">With bleared visages, come forth to view</li>
  <li class="number">The issue of th’ exploit. Go, Hercules,</li>
  <li class="number">Live thou, I live; with much, much more dismay</li>
  <li class="number">I view the fight than thou that mak’st the fray.</li>

  <li class="number">That only to stand high in your account,</li>
  <li class="number">I might in virtues, beauties, livings, friends,</li>
  <li class="number">Exceed account. But the full sum of me</li>
  <li class="number">Is sum of something; which, to term in gross,</li>
  <li class="number">Is an unlesson’d girl, unschool’d, unpractic’d,</li>
  <li class="number">Happy in this, she is not yet so old</li>
  <li class="number">But she may learn; happier than this,</li>
  <li class="number">She is not bred so dull but she can learn;</li>
  <li class="number">Happiest of all, is that her gentle spirit</li>
  <li class="number">Commits itself to yours to be directed,</li>
  <li class="number">As from her lord, her governor, her king.</li>
  <li class="number">Myself, and what is mine, to you and yours</li>

  <li class="number">This house, these servants, and this same myself</li>
  <li class="number">Are yours—my lord’s!—I give them with this ring,</li>

  <li class="number">And then I told you true. And yet, dear lady,</li>
  <li class="number">Rating myself at nothing, you shall see</li>
  <li class="number">How much I was a braggart: when I told you</li>
  <li class="number">My state was nothing, I should then have told you</li>
  <li class="number">That I was worse than nothing; for indeed</li>
  <li class="number">I have engag’d myself to a dear friend,</li>
  <li class="number">Engag’d my friend to his mere enemy,</li>
  <li class="number">To feed my means. Here is a letter, lady,</li>
  <li class="number">The paper as the body of my friend,</li>
  <li class="number">And every word in it a gaping wound</li>
  <li class="number">Issuing life-blood. But is it true, Salerio?</li>
  <li class="number">Hath all his ventures fail’d? What, not one hit?</li>
  <li class="number">From Tripolis, from Mexico, and England,</li>
  <li class="number">From Lisbon, Barbary, and India,</li>

  <li class="number">The quality of mercy is not strain’d,</li>

  <li class="number">’Tis mightiest in the mightiest, it becomes</li>
  <li class="number">The throned monarch better than his crown.</li>
  <li class="number">His sceptre shows the force of temporal power,</li>
  <li class="number">The attribute to awe and majesty,</li>
  <li class="number">Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;</li>
  <li class="number">But mercy is above this sceptred sway,</li>
  <li class="number">It is enthroned in the hearts of kings,</li>
  <li class="number">It is an attribute to God himself;</li>
  <li class="number">And earthly power doth then show likest God’s</li>
  <li class="number">When mercy seasons justice. Therefore, Jew,</li>
  <li class="number">Though justice be thy plea, consider this,</li>
  <li class="number">That in the course of justice, none of us</li>
  <li class="number">Should see salvation. We do pray for mercy,</li>
  <li class="number">And that same prayer doth teach us all to render</li>
  <li class="number">The deeds of mercy. I have spoke thus much</li>

  <li class="number">That she did give me, whose posy was</li>
  <li class="number">For all the world like cutler’s poetry</li>
  <li class="number">Upon a knife, “Love me, and leave me not.”</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NER.">
  <li class="number">What talk you of the posy or the value?</li>
  <li class="number">You swore to me, when I did give it you,</li>
  <li class="number">That you would wear it till your hour of death,</li>
  <li class="number">And that it should lie with you in your grave.</li>
  <li class="number">Though not for me, yet for your vehement oaths,</li>
  <li class="number">You should have been respective and have kept it.</li>
  <li class="number">Gave it a judge’s clerk! No, God’s my judge,</li>
  <li class="number">The clerk will ne’er wear hair on ’s face that had it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GRA.">
  <li class="number">He will, and if he live to be a man.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NER.">
  <li class="number">Ay, if a woman live to be a man.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GRA.">
  <li class="number">Now, by this hand, I gave it to a youth,</li>
  <li class="number">A kind of boy, a little scrubbed boy,</li>
  <li class="number">No higher than thyself, the judge’s clerk,</li>
  <li class="number">A prating boy, that begg’d it as a fee.</li>
  <li class="number">I could not for my heart deny it him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POR.">
  <li class="number">You were to blame, I must be plain with you,</li>
  <li class="number">To part so slightly with your wive’s first gift,</li>
  <li class="number">A thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger,</li>
  <li class="number">And so riveted with faith unto your flesh.</li>
  <li class="number">I gave my love a ring, and made him swear</li>
  <li class="number">Never to part with it, and here he stands.</li>
  <li class="number">I dare be sworn for him he would not leave it,</li>
  <li class="number">Nor pluck it from his finger, for the wealth</li>
  <li class="number">That the world masters. Now, in faith, Gratiano,</li>
  <li class="number">You give your wife too unkind a cause of grief;</li>
  <li class="number">And ’twere to me I should be mad at it.</li>

</li>
  <li class="number">Why, I were best to cut my left hand off,</li>
  <li class="number">And swear I lost the ring defending it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GRA.">
  <li class="number">My Lord Bassanio gave his ring away</li>
  <li class="number">Unto the judge that begg’d it, and indeed</li>
  <li class="number">Deserv’d it too; and then the boy, his clerk,</li>
  <li class="number">That took some pains in writing, he begg’d mine,</li>
  <li class="number">And neither man nor master would take aught</li>
  <li class="number">But the two rings.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POR.">
  <li class="number">What ring gave you, my lord?</li>
  <li class="number">Not that, I hope, which you receiv’d of me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BASS.">
  <li class="number">If I could add a lie unto a fault,</li>
  <li class="number">I would deny it; but you see my finger</li>
  <li class="number">Hath not the ring upon it, it is gone.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POR.">
  <li class="number">Even so void is your false heart of truth.</li>
  <li class="number">By heaven, I will ne’er come in your bed</li>
  <li class="number">Until I see the ring!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NER.">
  <li class="number">Nor I in yours</li>
  <li class="number">Till I again see mine!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BASS.">
  <li class="number">Sweet Portia,</li>
  <li class="number">If you did know to whom I gave the ring,</li>
  <li class="number">If you did know for whom I gave the ring,</li>
  <li class="number">And would conceive for what I gave the ring,</li>
  <li class="number">And how unwillingly I left the ring,</li>
  <li class="number">When nought would be accepted but the ring,</li>
  <li class="number">You would abate the strength of your displeasure.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POR.">
  <li class="number">If you had known the virtue of the ring,</li>
  <li class="number">Or half her worthiness that gave the ring,</li>
  <li class="number">Or your own honor to contain the ring,</li>
  <li class="number">You would not then have parted with the ring.</li>
  <li class="number">What man is there so much unreasonable,</li>
  <li class="number">If you had pleas’d to have defended it</li>
  <li class="number">With any terms of zeal, wanted the modesty</li>
  <li class="number">To urge the thing held as a ceremony?</li>
  <li class="number">Nerissa teaches me what to believe—</li>
  <li class="number">I’ll die for’t but some woman had the ring!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BASS.">
  <li class="number">No, by my honor, madam, by my soul,</li>
  <li class="number">No woman had it, but a civil doctor,</li>
  <li class="number">Which did refuse three thousand ducats of me,</li>
  <li class="number">And begg’d the ring, the which I did deny him,</li>
  <li class="number">And suffer’d him to go displeas’d away—</li>
  <li class="number">Even he that had held up the very life</li>
  <li class="number">Of my dear friend. What should I say, sweet lady?</li>
  <li class="number">I was enforc’d to send it after him,</li>
  <li class="number">I was beset with shame and courtesy,</li>
  <li class="number">My honor would not let ingratitude</li>
  <li class="number">So much besmear it. Pardon me, good lady,</li>
  <li class="number">For by these blessed candles of the night,</li>
  <li class="number">Had you been there, I think you would have begg’d</li>
  <li class="number">The ring of me to give the worthy doctor.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POR.">
  <li class="number">Let not that doctor e’er come near my house.</li>
  <li class="number">Since he hath got the jewel that I loved,</li>
  <li class="number">And that which you did swear to keep for me,</li>
  <li class="number">I will become as liberal as you,</li>
  <li class="number">I’ll not deny him any thing I have,</li>
  <li class="number">No, not my body nor my husband’s bed.</li>
  <li class="number">Know him I shall, I am well sure of it.</li>
  <li class="number">Lie not a night from home. Watch me like Argus;</li>
  <li class="number">If you do not, if I be left alone,</li>
  <li class="number">Now by mine honor, which is yet mine own,</li>
  <li class="number">I’ll have that doctor for my bedfellow.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NER.">
  <li class="number">And I his clerk; therefore be well advis’d</li>
  <li class="number">How you do leave me to mine own protection.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GRA.">
  <li class="number">Well, do you so; let not me take him then,</li>
  <li class="number">For if I do, I’ll mar the young clerk’s pen.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANT.">
  <li class="number">I am th’ unhappy subject of these quarrels.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POR.">
  <li class="number">Sir, grieve not you, you are welcome notwithstanding.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BASS.">
  <li class="number">Portia, forgive me this enforced wrong,</li>
  <li class="number">And in the hearing of these many friends</li>
  <li class="number">I swear to thee, even by thine own fair eyes,</li>
  <li class="number">Wherein I see myself—</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POR.">
  <li class="number">Mark you but that!</li>
  <li class="number">In both my eyes he doubly sees himself,</li>
  <li class="number">In each eye, one. Swear by your double self,</li>
  <li class="number">And there’s an oath of credit.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BASS.">
  <li class="number">Nay, but hear me.</li>
  <li class="number">Pardon this fault, and by my soul I swear</li>
  <li class="number">I never more will break an oath with thee.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANT.">
  <li class="number">I once did lend my body for his wealth,</li>
  <li class="number">Which but for him that had your husband’s ring</li>
  <li class="number">Had quite miscarried. I dare be bound again,</li>
  <li class="number">My soul upon the forfeit, that your lord</li>
  <li class="number">Will never more break faith advisedly.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POR.">
  <li class="number">Then you shall be his surety. Give him this,</li>
  <li class="number">And bid him keep it better than the other.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANT.">
  <li class="number">Here, Lord Bassanio, swear to keep this ring.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BASS.">
  <li class="number">By heaven, it is the same I gave the doctor!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POR.">
  <li class="number">I had it of him. Pardon me, Bassanio,</li>
  <li class="number">For by this ring, the doctor lay with me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NER.">
  <li class="number">And pardon me, my gentle Gratiano,</li>
  <li class="number">For that same scrubbed boy, the doctor’s clerk,</li>
  <li class="number">In lieu of this last night did lie with me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GRA.">
  <li class="number">Why, this is like the mending of highways</li>
  <li class="number">In summer, where the ways are fair enough.</li>
  <li class="number">What, are we cuckolds ere we have deserv’d it?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POR.">
  <li class="number">Speak not so grossly, you are all amaz’d.</li>
  <li class="number">Here is a letter, read it at your leisure.</li>
  <li class="number">It comes from Padua, from Bellario.</li>
  <li class="number">There you shall find that Portia was the doctor,</li>
  <li class="number">Nerissa there her clerk. Lorenzo here</li>
  <li class="number">Shall witness I set forth as soon as you,</li>
  <li class="number">And even but now return’d; I have not yet</li>
  <li class="number">Enter’d my house. Antonio, you are welcome,</li>
  <li class="number">And I have better news in store for you</li>
  <li class="number">Than you expect. Unseal this letter soon;</li>
  <li class="number">There you shall find three of your argosies</li>
  <li class="number">Are richly come to harbor suddenly.</li>
  <li class="number">You shall not know by what strange accident</li>
  <li class="number">I chanced on this letter.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANT.">
  <li class="number">I am dumb.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BASS.">
  <li class="number">Were you the doctor, and I knew you not?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GRA.">
  <li class="number">Were you the clerk that is to make me cuckold?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NER.">
  <li class="number">Ay, but the clerk that never means to do it,</li>
  <li class="number">Unless he live until he be a man.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BASS.">
  <li class="number">Sweet doctor, you shall be my bedfellow—</li>
  <li class="number">When I am absent, then lie with my wife.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANT.">
  <li class="number">Sweet lady, you have given me life and living,</li>
  <li class="number">For here I read for certain that my ships</li>
  <li class="number">Are safely come to road.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POR.">
  <li class="number">How now, Lorenzo?</li>
  <li class="number">My clerk hath some good comforts too for you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="NER.">
  <li class="number">Ay, and I’ll give them him without a fee.</li>
  <li class="number">There do I give to you and Jessica,</li>
  <li class="number">From the rich Jew, a special deed of gift,</li>
  <li class="number">After his death, of all he dies possess’d of.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LOR.">
  <li class="number">Fair ladies, you drop manna in the way</li>
  <li class="number">Of starved people.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="POR.">
  <li class="number">It is almost morning,</li>
  <li class="number">And yet I am sure you are not satisfied</li>
  <li class="number">Of these events at full. Let us go in,</li>
  <li class="number">And charge us there upon inter’gatories,</li>
  <li class="number">And we will answer all things faithfully.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GRA.">
  <li class="number">Let it be so. The first inter’gatory</li>
  <li class="number">That my Nerissa shall be sworn on is,</li>
  <li class="number">Whether till the next night she had rather stay,</li>
  <li class="number">Or go to bed now, being two hours to day.</li>
  <li class="number">But were the day come, I should wish it dark</li>
  <li class="number">Till I were couching with the doctor’s clerk.</li>
  <li class="number">Well, while I live I’ll fear no other thing</li>
  <li class="number">So sore, as keeping safe Nerissa’s ring.</li>
