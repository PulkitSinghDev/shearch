<h4>Padua. A public square.</h4>

<ol data-speaker="LUC.">
  <li class="number">Tranio, since for the great desire I had</li>
  <li class="number">To see fair Padua, nursery of arts,</li>
  <li class="number">I am arriv’d for fruitful Lombardy,</li>
  <li class="number">The pleasant garden of great Italy,</li>
  <li class="number">And by my father’s love and leave am arm’d</li>
  <li class="number">With his good will and thy good company,</li>
  <li class="number">My trusty servant, well approv’d in all,</li>
  <li class="number">Here let us breathe, and haply institute</li>
  <li class="number">A course of learning and ingenious studies.</li>
  <li class="number">Pisa, renowned for grave citizens,</li>
  <li class="number">Gave me my being and my father first,</li>
  <li class="number">A merchant of great traffic through the world,</li>
  <li class="number">Vincentio, come of the Bentivolii;</li>
  <li class="number">Vincentio’s son, brought up in Florence,</li>
  <li class="number">It shall become to serve all hopes conceiv’d,</li>
  <li class="number">To deck his fortune with his virtuous deeds.</li>
  <li class="number">And therefore, Tranio, for the time I study,</li>
  <li class="number">Virtue and that part of philosophy</li>
  <li class="number">Will I apply that treats of happiness</li>
  <li class="number">By virtue specially to be achiev’d.</li>
  <li class="number">Tell me thy mind, for I have Pisa left</li>
  <li class="number">And am to Padua come, as he that leaves</li>
  <li class="number">A shallow plash to plunge him in the deep,</li>
  <li class="number">And with satiety seeks to quench his thirst.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TRA.">
  <li class="number"><foreign xml:lang="it">Mi perdonato</foreign>, gentle master mine;</li>
  <li class="number">I am, in all affected as yourself,</li>
  <li class="number">Glad that you thus continue your resolve</li>
  <li class="number">To suck the sweets of sweet philosophy.</li>
  <li class="number">Only, good master, while we do admire</li>
  <li class="number">This virtue and this moral discipline,</li>
  <li class="number">Let’s be no Stoics nor no stocks, I pray,</li>
  <li class="number">Or so devote to Aristotle’s checks</li>
  <li class="number">As Ovid be an outcast quite abjur’d.</li>
  <li class="number">Balk logic with acquaintance that you have,</li>
  <li class="number">And practice rhetoric in your common talk,</li>
  <li class="number">Music and poesy use to quicken you,</li>
  <li class="number">The mathematics, and the metaphysics,</li>
  <li class="number">Fall to them as you find your stomach serves you:</li>
  <li class="number">No profit grows where is no pleasure ta’en.</li>
  <li class="number">In brief, sir, study what you most affect.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUC.">
  <li class="number">Gramercies, Tranio, well dost thou advise.</li>
  <li class="number">If, Biondello, thou wert come ashore,</li>
  <li class="number">We could at once put us in readiness,</li>
  <li class="number">And take a lodging fit to entertain</li>
  <li class="number">Such friends as time in Padua shall beget.</li>
  <li class="number">But stay a while, what company is this?</li>

  <li class="number">I’ faith, sir, you shall never need to fear.</li>

  <li class="number">To comb your noddle with a three-legg’d stool,</li>
  <li class="number">And paint your face, and use you like a fool.</li>

  <li class="number">You may go to the devil’s dam; your gifts are so good, here’s none will hold you. Their love is not so great, Hortensio, but we may blow our nails together, and fast it fairly out. Our cake’s dough on both sides. Farewell; yet for the love I bear my sweet Bianca, if I can by any means light on a fit man to teach her that wherein she delights, I will wish him to her father.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HOR.">
  <li class="number">So will I, <foreign xml:lang="it">Signior</foreign> Gremio. But a word, I pray. Though the nature of our quarrel yet never brook’d parle, know now upon advice, it toucheth us both, that we may yet again have access to our fair mistress, and be happy rivals in Bianca’s love, to labor and effect one thing specially.</li>

  <li class="number">What’s that, I pray?</li>

<ol data-speaker="HOR.">
  <li class="number">Marry, sir, to get a husband for her sister.</li>

<ol data-speaker="GRE.">
  <li class="number">A husband! A devil.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HOR.">
  <li class="number">I say, a husband.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GRE.">
  <li class="number">I say, a devil. Think’st thou, Hortensio, though her father be very rich, any man is so very a fool to be married to hell?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HOR.">
  <li class="number">Tush, Gremio; though it pass your patience and mine to endure her loud alarums, why, man, there be good
 fellows in the world, and a man could light on them, would take her with all faults, and money enough.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GRE.">
  <li class="number">I cannot tell; but I had as lief take her dowry with this condition: to be whipt at the high cross every morning.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HOR.">
  <li class="number">Faith, as you say, there’s small choice in rotten apples. But come, since this bar in law makes us friends, it shall be so far forth friendly maintain’d till by helping Baptista’s eldest daughter to a husband we set his youngest free for a husband, and then have to’t afresh. Sweet Bianca, happy man be his dole! He that runs fastest gets the ring. How say you, <foreign xml:lang="it">Signior</foreign> Gremio?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GRE.">
  <li class="number">I am agreed, and would I had given him the best horse in Padua to begin his wooing that would thoroughly woo her, wed her, and bed her, and rid the house of her! Come on.</li>

<ol data-speaker="TRA.">
  <li class="number">I pray, sir, tell me, is it possible</li>
  <li class="number">That love should of a sudden take such hold?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUC.">
  <li class="number">O Tranio, till I found it to be true,</li>
  <li class="number">I never thought it possible or likely.</li>
  <li class="number">But see, while idly I stood looking on,</li>
  <li class="number">I found the effect of love in idleness,</li>
  <li class="number">And now in plainness do confess to thee,</li>
  <li class="number">That art to me as secret and as dear</li>
  <li class="number">As Anna to the Queen of Carthage was:</li>
  <li class="number">Tranio, I burn, I pine, I perish, Tranio,</li>
  <li class="number">If I achieve not this young modest girl.</li>
  <li class="number">Counsel me, Tranio, for I know thou canst;</li>
  <li class="number">Assist me, Tranio, for I know thou wilt.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TRA.">
  <li class="number">Master, it is no time to chide you now,</li>
  <li class="number">Affection is not rated from the heart.</li>
  <li class="number">If love have touch’d you, nought remains but so,</li>
  <li class="number"><foreign xml:lang="la">“Redime te captum quam queas minimo.”</foreign></li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUC.">
  <li class="number">Gramercies, lad. Go forward, this contents;</li>
  <li class="number">The rest will comfort, for thy counsel’s sound.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TRA.">
  <li class="number">Master, you look’d so longly on the maid,</li>
  <li class="number">Perhaps you mark’d not what’s the pith of all.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUC.">
  <li class="number">O yes, I saw sweet beauty in her face,</li>
  <li class="number">Such as the daughter of Agenor had,</li>
  <li class="number">That made great Jove to humble him to her hand,</li>
  <li class="number">When with his knees he kiss’d the Cretan strond.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TRA.">
  <li class="number">Saw you no more? Mark’d you not how her sister</li>
  <li class="number">Began to scold, and raise up such a storm</li>
  <li class="number">That mortal ears might hardly endure the din?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUC.">
  <li class="number">Tranio, I saw her coral lips to move,</li>
  <li class="number">And with her breath she did perfume the air.</li>
  <li class="number">Sacred and sweet was all I saw in her.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TRA.">
  <li class="number">Nay, then ’tis time to stir him from his trance.</li>
  <li class="number">I pray, awake, sir; if you love the maid,</li>
  <li class="number">Bend thoughts and wits to achieve her. Thus it stands:</li>
  <li class="number">Her elder sister is so curst and shrewd</li>
  <li class="number">That till the father rid his hands of her,</li>
  <li class="number">Master, your love must live a maid at home,</li>
  <li class="number">And therefore has he closely mew’d her up,</li>
  <li class="number">Because she will not be annoy’d with suitors.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUC.">
  <li class="number">Ah, Tranio, what a cruel father’s he?</li>
  <li class="number">But art thou not advis’d, he took some care</li>
  <li class="number">To get her cunning schoolmasters to instruct her?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TRA.">
  <li class="number">Ay, marry, am I, sir; and now ’tis plotted.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUC.">
  <li class="number">I have it, Tranio.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TRA.">
  <li class="number">Master, for my hand,</li>
  <li class="number">Both our inventions meet and jump in one.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUC.">
  <li class="number">Tell me thine first.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TRA.">
  <li class="number">You will be schoolmaster,</li>
  <li class="number">And undertake the teaching of the maid:</li>
  <li class="number">That’s your device.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUC.">
  <li class="number">It is; may it be done?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TRA.">
  <li class="number">Not possible; for who shall bear your part,</li>
  <li class="number">And be in Padua here Vincentio’s son,</li>
  <li class="number">Keep house and ply his book, welcome his friends,</li>
  <li class="number">Visit his countrymen, and banquet them?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUC.">
  <li class="number"><foreign xml:lang="it">Basta</foreign>, content thee; for I have it full.</li>
  <li class="number">We have not yet been seen in any house,</li>
  <li class="number">Nor can we be distinguish’d by our faces</li>
  <li class="number">For man or master. Then it follows thus:</li>
  <li class="number">Thou shalt be master, Tranio, in my stead;</li>
  <li class="number">Keep house and port and servants, as I should.</li>
  <li class="number">I will some other be, some Florentine,</li>
  <li class="number">Some Neapolitan, or meaner man of Pisa.</li>
  <li class="number">’Tis hatch’d, and shall be so. Tranio, at once</li>
  <li class="number">Uncase thee; take my color’d hat and cloak.</li>
  <li class="number">When Biondello comes, he waits on thee,</li>
  <li class="number">But I will charm him first to keep his tongue.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="TRA.">
  <li class="number">So had you need.</li>
  <li class="number">In brief, sir, sith it your pleasure is,</li>
  <li class="number">And I am tied to be obedient—</li>
  <li class="number">For so your father charg’d me at our parting;</li>
  <li class="number">“Be serviceable to my son,” quoth he,</li>
  <li class="number">Although I think ’twas in another sense—</li>
  <li class="number">I am content to be Lucentio,</li>
  <li class="number">Because so well I love Lucentio.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUC.">
  <li class="number">Tranio, be so, because Lucentio loves,</li>
  <li class="number">And let me be a slave, t’ achieve that maid</li>
  <li class="number">Whose sudden sight hath thrall’d my wounded eye.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">
	Enter Biondello.

<ol data-speaker="BION.">
  <li class="number">Where have I been? Nay, how now, where are you? Master, has my fellow Tranio stol’n your clothes? Or you stol’n his? Or both? Pray what’s the news?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LUC.">
  <li class="number">Sirrah, come hither, ’tis no time to jest,</li>
  <li class="number">And therefore frame your manners to the time.</li>
  <li class="number">Your fellow Tranio here, to save my life,</li>
  <li class="number">Puts my apparel and my count’nance on,</li>
  <li class="number">And I for my escape have put on his;</li>
  <li class="number">For in a quarrel since I came ashore</li>
  <li class="number">I kill’d a man, and fear I was descried.</li>
  <li class="number">Wait you on him, I charge you, as becomes,</li>
  <li class="number">While I make way from hence to save my life.</li>
  <li class="number">You understand me?</li>

  <li class="number">Sirrah, be gone, or talk not, I advise you.</li>

<ol data-speaker="HOR.">
  <li class="number">Petruchio, patience, I am Grumio’s pledge.</li>
  <li class="number">Why, this’ a heavy chance ’twixt him and you,</li>
  <li class="number">Your ancient, trusty, pleasant servant Grumio.</li>
  <li class="number">And tell me now, sweet friend, what happy gale</li>
  <li class="number">Blows you to Padua here from old Verona?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PET.">
  <li class="number">Such wind as scatters young men through the world</li>
  <li class="number">To seek their fortunes farther than at home,</li>
  <li class="number">Where small experience grows. But in a few,</li>
  <li class="number"><foreign xml:lang="it">Signior</foreign> Hortensio, thus it stands with me:</li>
  <li class="number">Antonio, my father, is deceas’d,</li>
  <li class="number">And I have thrust myself into this maze,</li>
  <li class="number">Happily to wive and thrive as best I may.</li>
  <li class="number">Crowns in my purse I have, and goods at home,</li>
  <li class="number">And so am come abroad to see the world.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HOR.">
  <li class="number">Petruchio, shall I then come roundly to thee,</li>
  <li class="number">And wish thee to a shrewd ill-favor’d wife?</li>
  <li class="number">Thou’dst thank me but a little for my counsel;</li>
  <li class="number">And yet I’ll promise thee she shall be rich,</li>
  <li class="number">And very rich. But th’ art too much my friend,</li>
  <li class="number">And I’ll not wish thee to her.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PET.">
  <li class="number"><foreign xml:lang="it">Signior</foreign> Hortensio, ’twixt such friends as we</li>
  <li class="number">Few words suffice; and therefore, if thou know</li>
  <li class="number">One rich enough to be Petruchio’s wife</li>
  <li class="number">(As wealth is burden of my wooing dance),</li>
  <li class="number">Be she as foul as was Florentius’ love,</li>
  <li class="number">As old as Sibyl, and as curst and shrewd</li>
  <li class="number">As Socrates’ Xantippe, or a worse,</li>
  <li class="number">She moves me not, or not removes at least</li>
  <li class="number">Affection’s edge in me. Whe’er she is as rough</li>
  <li class="number">As are the swelling Adriatic seas,</li>
  <li class="number">I come to wive it wealthily in Padua;</li>
  <li class="number">If wealthily, then happily in Padua.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GRU.">
  <li class="number">Nay, look you, sir, he tells you flatly what his mind is. Why, give him gold enough, and marry him to a puppet or an aglet-baby, or an old trot with ne’er a tooth in her head, though she have as many diseases as two and fifty horses. Why, nothing comes amiss, so money comes withal.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HOR.">
  <li class="number">Petruchio, since we are stepp’d thus far in,</li>
  <li class="number">I will continue that I broach’d in jest.</li>
  <li class="number">I can, Petruchio, help thee to a wife</li>
  <li class="number">With wealth enough, and young and beauteous,</li>
  <li class="number">Brought up as best becomes a gentlewoman.</li>
  <li class="number">Her only fault, and that is faults enough,</li>
  <li class="number">Is that she is intolerable curst</li>
  <li class="number">And shrewd and froward, so beyond all measure,</li>
  <li class="number">That were my state far worser than it is,</li>
  <li class="number">I would not wed her for a mine of gold.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PET.">
  <li class="number">Hortensio, peace! Thou know’st not gold’s effect.</li>
  <li class="number">Tell me her father’s name, and ’tis enough;</li>
  <li class="number">For I will board her, though she chide as loud</li>
  <li class="number">As thunder when the clouds in autumn crack.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HOR.">
  <li class="number">Her father is Baptista Minola,</li>
  <li class="number">An affable and courteous gentleman.</li>
  <li class="number">Her name is Katherina Minola,</li>
  <li class="number">Renown’d in Padua for her scolding tongue.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="PET.">
  <li class="number">I know her father, though I know not her,</li>
  <li class="number">And he knew my deceased father well.</li>
  <li class="number">I will not sleep, Hortensio, till I see her,</li>
  <li class="number">And therefore let me be thus bold with you</li>
  <li class="number">To give you over at this first encounter,</li>
  <li class="number">Unless you will accompany me thither.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GRU.">
  <li class="number">I pray you, sir, let him go while the humor lasts. A’ my word, and she knew him as well as I do, she would think scolding would do little good upon him. She may perhaps call him half a score knaves or so. Why, that’s nothing; and he begin once, he’ll rail in his rope-tricks. I’ll tell you what, sir, and she stand him but a little, he will throw a figure in her face, and so disfigure her with it, that she shall have no more eyes to see withal than a cat. You know him not, sir.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HOR.">
  <li class="number">Tarry, Petruchio, I must go with thee,</li>

  <li class="number">His youngest daughter, beautiful Bianca,</li>
  <li class="number">And her withholds from me and other more,</li>
  <li class="number">Suitors to her and rivals in my love;</li>
  <li class="number">Supposing it a thing impossible,</li>
  <li class="number">For those defects I have before rehears’d,</li>
  <li class="number">That ever Katherina will be woo’d.</li>
  <li class="number">Therefore this order hath Baptista ta’en,</li>

  <li class="number">O, sir, his lackey, for all the world caparison’d like the horse; with a linen stock on one leg, and a kersey boot-hose on the other, gart’red with a red and blue list; an old hat, and the humor of forty fancies prick’d in’t for a feather: a monster, a very monster in apparel, and not like a Christian footboy or a gentleman’s lackey.</li>

  <li class="number">Fie, fie on all tir’d jades, on all mad masters, and all foul ways! Was ever man so beaten? Was ever man so ray’d? Was ever man so weary?

Now were not I a little pot and soon hot, my very lips might freeze to my teeth, my tongue to the roof of my mouth, my heart in my belly, ere I should come by a fire to thaw me. But I with blowing the fire shall warm myself; for considering the weather, a taller man than I will take cold. Holla, ho, Curtis!</li>

  <li class="number">Why are our bodies soft, and weak, and smooth,</li>
