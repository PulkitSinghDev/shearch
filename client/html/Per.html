  <li class="number">Why should this change of thoughts,</li>

  <li class="number">Be my so us’d a guest as not an hour</li>
  <li class="number">In the day’s glorious walk or peaceful night,</li>
  <li class="number">The tomb where grief should sleep, can breed me quiet?</li>
  <li class="number">Here pleasures court mine eyes, and mine eyes shun them,</li>
  <li class="number">And danger, which I fear’d, is at Antioch,</li>
  <li class="number">Whose arm seems far too short to hit me here.</li>
  <li class="number">Yet neither pleasure’s art can joy my spirits,</li>

  <li class="number">And what was first but fear what might be done,</li>
  <li class="number">Grows elder now, and cares it be not done.</li>
  <li class="number">And so with me: the great Antiochus,</li>
  <li class="number">’Gainst whom I am too little to contend,</li>
  <li class="number">Since he’s so great can make his will his act,</li>
  <li class="number">Will think me speaking, though I swear to silence;</li>

  <li class="number">If he suspect I may dishonor him;</li>
  <li class="number">And what may make him blush in being known,</li>
  <li class="number">He’ll stop the course by which it might be known.</li>
  <li class="number">With hostile forces he’ll o’erspread the land,</li>

  <li class="number">Amazement shall drive courage from the state,</li>
