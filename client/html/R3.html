<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li class="number">Now is the winter of our discontent</li>
  <li class="number">Made glorious summer by this son of York;</li>
  <li class="number">And all the clouds that low’r’d upon our house</li>
  <li class="number">In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.</li>
  <li class="number">Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths,</li>
  <li class="number">Our bruised arms hung up for monuments,</li>
  <li class="number">Our stern alarums chang’d to merry meetings,</li>
  <li class="number">Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.</li>
  <li class="number">Grim-visag’d War hath smooth’d his wrinkled front;</li>
  <li class="number">And now, in stead of mounting barbed steeds</li>
  <li class="number">To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,</li>
  <li class="number">He capers nimbly in a lady’s chamber</li>
  <li class="number">To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.</li>
  <li class="number">But I, that am not shap’d for sportive tricks,</li>
  <li class="number">Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass;</li>
  <li class="number">I, that am rudely stamp’d, and want love’s majesty</li>
  <li class="number">To strut before a wanton ambling nymph;</li>
  <li class="number">I, that am curtail’d of this fair proportion,</li>
  <li class="number">Cheated of feature by dissembling nature,</li>
  <li class="number">Deform’d, unfinish’d, sent before my time</li>
  <li class="number">Into this breathing world, scarce half made up,</li>
  <li class="number">And that so lamely and unfashionable</li>
  <li class="number">That dogs bark at me as I halt by them—</li>
  <li class="number">Why, I, in this weak piping time of peace,</li>
  <li class="number">Have no delight to pass away the time,</li>
  <li class="number">Unless to see my shadow in the sun</li>
  <li class="number">And descant on mine own deformity.</li>
  <li class="number">And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover</li>
  <li class="number">To entertain these fair well-spoken days,</li>
  <li class="number">I am determined to prove a villain</li>
  <li class="number">And hate the idle pleasures of these days.</li>
  <li class="number">Plots have I laid, inductions dangerous,</li>
  <li class="number">By drunken prophecies, libels, and dreams,</li>
  <li class="number">To set my brother Clarence and the King</li>
  <li class="number">In deadly hate the one against the other;</li>
  <li class="number">And if King Edward be as true and just</li>
  <li class="number">As I am subtle, false, and treacherous,</li>
  <li class="number">This day should Clarence closely be mew’d up</li>
  <li class="number">About a prophecy, which says that G</li>
  <li class="number">Of Edward’s heirs the murderer shall be.</li>
  <li class="number">Dive, thoughts, down to my soul, here Clarence comes!</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">
	Enter Clarence, guarded, and Brakenbury, Lieutenant of the Tower.

</li>
  <li class="number">Brother, good day. What means this armed guard</li>
  <li class="number">That waits upon your Grace?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLAR.">
  <li class="number">His Majesty,</li>
  <li class="number">Tend’ring my person’s safety, hath appointed</li>
  <li class="number">This conduct to convey me to the Tower.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li class="number">Upon what cause?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLAR.">
  <li class="number">Because my name is George.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li class="number">Alack, my lord, that fault is none of yours;</li>
  <li class="number">He should for that commit your godfathers.</li>
  <li class="number">O, belike his Majesty hath some intent</li>
  <li class="number">That you should be new christ’ned in the Tower.</li>
  <li class="number">But what’s the matter, Clarence, may I know?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLAR.">
  <li class="number">Yea, Richard, when I know; but I protest</li>
  <li class="number">As yet I do not. But, as I can learn,</li>
  <li class="number">He hearkens after prophecies and dreams,</li>
  <li class="number">And from the cross-row plucks the letter G,</li>
  <li class="number">And says a wizard told him that by G</li>
  <li class="number">His issue disinherited should be;</li>
  <li class="number">And for my name of George begins with G,</li>
  <li class="number">It follows in his thought that I am he.</li>
  <li class="number">These (as I learn) and such-like toys as these</li>
  <li class="number">Hath mov’d his Highness to commit me now.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li class="number">Why, this it is, when men are rul’d by women:</li>
  <li class="number">’Tis not the King that sends you to the Tower;</li>
  <li class="number">My Lady Grey his wife, Clarence, ’tis she</li>
  <li class="number">That tempers him to this extremity.</li>
  <li class="number">Was it not she, and that good man of worship,</li>
  <li class="number">Anthony Woodvile, her brother there,</li>
  <li class="number">That made him send Lord Hastings to the Tower,</li>
  <li class="number">From whence this present day he is delivered?</li>
  <li class="number">We are not safe, Clarence, we are not safe.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLAR.">
  <li class="number">By heaven, I think there is no man is secure</li>
  <li class="number">But the Queen’s kindred, and night-walking heralds</li>
  <li class="number">That trudge betwixt the King and Mistress Shore.</li>
  <li class="number">Heard you not what an humble suppliant</li>
  <li class="number">Lord Hastings was to her for his delivery?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li class="number">Humbly complaining to her deity</li>
  <li class="number">Got my Lord Chamberlain his liberty.</li>
  <li class="number">I’ll tell you what, I think it is our way,</li>
  <li class="number">If we will keep in favor with the King,</li>
  <li class="number">To be her men and wear her livery.</li>
  <li class="number">The jealous o’erworn widow and herself,</li>
  <li class="number">Since that our brother dubb’d them gentlewomen,</li>
  <li class="number">Are mighty gossips in our monarchy.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BRAK.">
  <li class="number">I beseech your Graces both to pardon me:</li>
  <li class="number">His Majesty hath straitly given in charge</li>
  <li class="number">That no man shall have private conference</li>
  <li class="number">(Of what degree soever) with your brother.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li class="number">Even so? And please your worship, Brakenbury,</li>
  <li class="number">You may partake of any thing we say:</li>
  <li class="number">We speak no treason, man. We say the King</li>
  <li class="number">Is wise and virtuous, and his noble queen</li>
  <li class="number">Well struck in years, fair, and not jealous;</li>
  <li class="number">We say that Shore’s wife hath a pretty foot,</li>
  <li class="number">A cherry lip, a bonny eye, a passing pleasing tongue;</li>
  <li class="number">And that the Queen’s kindred are made gentlefolks.</li>
  <li class="number">How say you, sir? Can you deny all this?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BRAK.">
  <li class="number">With this, my lord, myself have nought to do.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li class="number">Naught to do with Mistress Shore? I tell thee, fellow,</li>
  <li class="number">He that doth naught with her (excepting one)</li>
  <li class="number">Were best to do it secretly alone.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BRAK.">
  <li class="number">What one, my lord?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li class="number">Her husband, knave. Wouldst thou betray me?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BRAK.">
  <li class="number">I do beseech your Grace to pardon me, and withal</li>
  <li class="number">Forbear your conference with the noble Duke.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLAR.">
  <li class="number">We know thy charge, Brakenbury, and will obey.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li class="number">We are the Queen’s abjects, and must obey.</li>
  <li class="number">Brother, farewell, I will unto the King,</li>
  <li class="number">And whatsoe’er you will employ me in,</li>
  <li class="number">Were it to call King Edward’s widow sister,</li>
  <li class="number">I will perform it to enfranchise you.</li>
  <li class="number">Mean time, this deep disgrace in brotherhood</li>
  <li class="number">Touches me deeper than you can imagine.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLAR.">
  <li class="number">I know it pleaseth neither of us well.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li class="number">Well, your imprisonment shall not be long,</li>
  <li class="number">I will deliver you, or else lie for you.</li>
  <li class="number">Mean time, have patience.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLAR.">
  <li class="number">I must perforce. Farewell.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li class="number">Go tread the path that thou shalt ne’er return:</li>
  <li class="number">Simple plain Clarence, I do love thee so</li>
  <li class="number">That I will shortly send thy soul to heaven,</li>
  <li class="number">If heaven will take the present at our hands.</li>
  <li class="number">But who comes here? The new-delivered Hastings?</li>
</ol>

<div class="stage-direction">
	Enter Lord Hastings.
	
		HAST.
	
</div>

<ol data-speaker="HAST.">
  <li class="number">Good time of day unto my gracious lord!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li class="number">As much unto my good Lord Chamberlain!</li>
  <li class="number">Well are you welcome to the open air.</li>
  <li class="number">How hath your lordship brook’d imprisonment?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAST.">
  <li class="number">With patience, noble lord, as prisoners must;</li>
  <li class="number">But I shall live, my lord, to give them thanks</li>
  <li class="number">That were the cause of my imprisonment.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li class="number">No doubt, no doubt, and so shall Clarence too,</li>
  <li class="number">For they that were your enemies are his,</li>
  <li class="number">And have prevail’d as much on him as you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAST.">
  <li class="number">More pity that the eagles should be mew’d,</li>
  <li class="number">Whiles kites and buzzards prey at liberty.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li class="number">What news abroad?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAST.">
  <li class="number">No news so bad abroad as this at home:</li>
  <li class="number">The King is sickly, weak, and melancholy,</li>
  <li class="number">And his physicians fear him mightily.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li class="number">Now by Saint John, that news is bad indeed!</li>
  <li class="number">O, he hath kept an evil diet long,</li>
  <li class="number">And overmuch consum’d his royal person:</li>
  <li class="number">’Tis very grievous to be thought upon.</li>
  <li class="number">Where is he? In his bed?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="HAST.">
  <li class="number">He is.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li class="number">Go you before, and I will follow you.</li>
  <li class="stage-direction">
	Exit Hastings.
	
		HAST.
	
</li>
  <li class="number">He cannot live, I hope, and must not die</li>
  <li class="number">Till George be pack’d with post-horse up to heaven.</li>
  <li class="number">I’ll in, to urge his hatred more to Clarence</li>
  <li class="number">With lies well steel’d with weighty arguments,</li>
  <li class="number">And if I fail not in my deep intent,</li>
  <li class="number">Clarence hath not another day to live:</li>
  <li class="number">Which done, God take King Edward to his mercy,</li>
  <li class="number">And leave the world for me to bustle in!</li>
  <li class="number">For then I’ll marry Warwick’s youngest daughter.</li>
  <li class="number">What though I kill’d her husband and her father?</li>
  <li class="number">The readiest way to make the wench amends</li>
  <li class="number">Is to become her husband and her father:</li>
  <li class="number">The which will I, not all so much for love</li>
  <li class="number">As for another secret close intent</li>
  <li class="number">By marrying her which I must reach unto.</li>
  <li class="number">But yet I run before my horse to market:</li>
  <li class="number">Clarence still breathes, Edward still lives and reigns;</li>
  <li class="number">When they are gone, then must I count my gains.</li>

  <li class="number">Poor key-cold figure of a holy king,</li>
  <li class="number">Pale ashes of the house of Lancaster,</li>

  <li class="number">More direful hap betide that hated wretch</li>
  <li class="number">That makes us wretched by the death of thee</li>

  <li class="number">Foul devil, for God’s sake hence, and trouble us not,</li>
  <li class="number">For thou hast made the happy earth thy hell,</li>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li class="number">More wonderful, when angels are so angry.</li>
  <li class="number">Vouchsafe, divine perfection of a woman,</li>

<ol data-speaker="ANNE.">
  <li class="number">Vouchsafe, defus’d infection of a man,</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li class="number">Fairer than tongue can name thee, let me have</li>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li class="number">Say that I slew them not?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANNE.">
  <li class="number">Then say they were not slain.</li>
  <li class="number">But dead they are, and, devilish slave, by thee.</li>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li class="number">I did not kill your husband.</li>

<ol data-speaker="ANNE.">
  <li class="number">Why then he is alive.</li>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li class="number">Nay, he is dead, and slain by Edward’s hands.</li>

<ol data-speaker="ANNE.">
  <li class="number">In thy foul throat thou li’st! Queen Margaret saw</li>
  <li class="number">Thy murd’rous falchion smoking in his blood;</li>
  <li class="number">The which thou once didst bend against her breast,</li>
  <li class="number">But that thy brothers beat aside the point.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li class="number">I was provoked by her sland’rous tongue,</li>
  <li class="number">That laid their guilt upon my guiltless shoulders.</li>

<ol data-speaker="ANNE.">
  <li class="number">Thou wast provoked by thy bloody mind,</li>
  <li class="number">That never dream’st on aught but butcheries.</li>
  <li class="number">Didst thou not kill this king?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li class="number">I grant ye.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANNE.">
  <li class="number">Dost grant me, hedgehog? Then God grant me too</li>
  <li class="number">Thou mayst be damned for that wicked deed!</li>
  <li class="number">O, he was gentle, mild, and virtuous!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li class="number">The better for the King of Heaven that hath him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANNE.">
  <li class="number">He is in heaven, where thou shalt never come.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li class="number">Let him thank me that holp to send him thither;</li>
  <li class="number">For he was fitter for that place than earth.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANNE.">
  <li class="number">And thou unfit for any place, but hell.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li class="number">Yes, one place else, if you will hear me name it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANNE.">
  <li class="number">Some dungeon.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li class="number">Your bedchamber.</li>

<ol data-speaker="ANNE.">
  <li class="number">Ill rest betide the chamber where thou liest!</li>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li class="number">So will it, madam, till I lie with you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANNE.">
  <li class="number">I hope so.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li class="number">I know so. But, gentle Lady Anne,</li>
  <li class="number">To leave this keen encounter of our wits</li>
  <li class="number">And fall something into a slower method:</li>
  <li class="number">Is not the causer of the timeless deaths</li>
  <li class="number">Of these Plantagenets, Henry and Edward,</li>
  <li class="number">As blameful as the executioner?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANNE.">
  <li class="number">Thou wast the cause, and most accurs’d effect.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li class="number">Your beauty was the cause of that effect—</li>
  <li class="number">Your beauty, that did haunt me in my sleep</li>
  <li class="number">To undertake the death of all the world,</li>
  <li class="number">So I might live one hour in your sweet bosom.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANNE.">
  <li class="number">If I thought that, I tell thee, homicide,</li>
  <li class="number">These nails should rent that beauty from my cheeks.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="GLOU.">
  <li class="number">These eyes could not endure that beauty’s wrack;</li>
  <li class="number">You should not blemish it, if I stood by:</li>
  <li class="number">As all the world is cheered by the sun,</li>
  <li class="number">So I by that; it is my day, my life.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ANNE.">
  <li class="number">Black night o’ershade thy day, and death thy life!</li>

  <li class="number">Why looks your Grace so heavily today?</li>

  <li class="number">O, I have pass’d a miserable night,</li>
  <li class="number">So full of fearful dreams, of ugly sights,</li>
  <li class="number">That, as I am a Christian faithful man,</li>
  <li class="number">I would not spend another such a night</li>
  <li class="number">Though ’twere to buy a world of happy days—</li>
  <li class="number">So full of dismal terror was the time.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KEEP.">
  <li class="number">What was your dream, my lord? I pray you tell me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLAR.">
  <li class="number">Methoughts that I had broken from the Tower</li>
  <li class="number">And was embark’d to cross to Burgundy,</li>
  <li class="number">And in my company my brother Gloucester,</li>
  <li class="number">Who from my cabin tempted me to walk</li>
  <li class="number">Upon the hatches. Thence we look’d toward England,</li>
  <li class="number">And cited up a thousand heavy times,</li>
  <li class="number">During the wars of York and Lancaster,</li>
  <li class="number">That had befall’n us. As we pac’d along</li>
  <li class="number">Upon the giddy footing of the hatches,</li>
  <li class="number">Methought that Gloucester stumbled, and in falling</li>
  <li class="number">Struck me (that thought to stay him) overboard</li>
  <li class="number">Into the tumbling billows of the main.</li>
  <li class="number">O Lord, methought what pain it was to drown!</li>
  <li class="number">What dreadful noise of waters in my ears!</li>
  <li class="number">What sights of ugly death within my eyes!</li>
  <li class="number">Methoughts I saw a thousand fearful wracks;</li>
  <li class="number">A thousand men that fishes gnaw’d upon;</li>
  <li class="number">Wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl,</li>
  <li class="number">Inestimable stones, unvalued jewels,</li>
  <li class="number">All scatt’red in the bottom of the sea:</li>
  <li class="number">Some lay in dead men’s skulls, and in the holes</li>
  <li class="number">Where eyes did once inhabit, there were crept</li>
  <li class="number">(As ’twere in scorn of eyes) reflecting gems,</li>
  <li class="number">That woo’d the slimy bottom of the deep,</li>
  <li class="number">And mock’d the dead bones that lay scatt’red by.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KEEP.">
  <li class="number">Had you such leisure in the time of death</li>
  <li class="number">To gaze upon these secrets of the deep?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CLAR.">
  <li class="number">Methought I had, and often did I strive</li>
  <li class="number">To yield the ghost; but still the envious flood</li>
  <li class="number">Stopp’d in my soul, and would not let it forth</li>
  <li class="number">To find the empty, vast, and wand’ring air,</li>
  <li class="number">But smother’d it within my panting bulk,</li>
  <li class="number">Who almost burst to belch it in the sea.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KEEP.">

  <li class="number">No, no, my dream was lengthen’d after life.</li>
  <li class="number">O then began the tempest to my soul!</li>
  <li class="number">I pass’d (methought) the melancholy flood,</li>
  <li class="number">With that sour ferryman which poets write of,</li>
  <li class="number">Unto the kingdom of perpetual night.</li>
  <li class="number">The first that there did greet my stranger soul</li>
  <li class="number">Was my great father-in-law, renowned Warwick,</li>
  <li class="number">Who spake aloud, “What scourge for perjury</li>
  <li class="number">Can this dark monarchy afford false Clarence?”</li>
  <li class="number">And so he vanish’d. Then came wand’ring by</li>
  <li class="number">A shadow like an angel, with bright hair</li>
  <li class="number">Dabbled in blood, and he shriek’d out aloud,</li>
  <li class="number">“Clarence is come—false, fleeting, perjur’d Clarence,</li>
  <li class="number">That stabb’d me in the field by Tewksbury:</li>
  <li class="number">Seize on him, Furies, take him unto torment!”</li>
  <li class="number">With that (methoughts) a legion of foul fiends</li>
  <li class="number">Environ’d me, and howled in mine ears</li>
  <li class="number">Such hideous cries that with the very noise</li>
  <li class="number">I, trembling, wak’d, and for a season after</li>
  <li class="number">Could not believe but that I was in hell,</li>
  <li class="number">Such terrible impression made my dream.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KEEP.">
  <li class="number">No marvel, lord, though it affrighted you;</li>
  <li class="number">I am afraid (methinks) to hear you tell it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="KEEP.">
  <li class="number">Ah, Keeper, Keeper, I have done these things</li>
  <li class="number">(That now give evidence against my soul)</li>
  <li class="number">For Edward’s sake, and see how he requites me!</li>
  <li class="number">O God! If my deep pray’rs cannot appease thee,</li>
  <li class="number">But thou wilt be aveng’d on my misdeeds,</li>
  <li class="number">Yet execute thy wrath in me alone!</li>
  <li class="number">O, spare my guiltless wife and my poor children!</li>
  <li class="number">Keeper, I prithee sit by me awhile.</li>
  <li class="number">My soul is heavy, and I fain would sleep.</li>

  <li class="number">I’ll not meddle with it, it makes a man a coward.

It fills a man full of obstacles. It made me once restore a purse of gold that (by chance) I found. It beggars any man that keeps it. It is turn’d out of towns and cities for a dangerous thing, and every man that means to live well endeavors to trust to himself and live without it.</li>

  <li class="number">No, boy.</li>

<ol data-speaker="MARG.">
  <li class="number">Why do you weep so oft, and beat your breast,</li>
  <li class="number">And cry, “O Clarence, my unhappy son!”?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="EDW.">
  <li class="number">Why do you look on us, and shake your head,</li>

  <li class="number">If that our noble father were alive?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUCH.">
  <li class="number">My pretty cousins, you mistake me both:</li>
  <li class="number">I do lament the sickness of the King,</li>
  <li class="number">As loath to lose him, not your father’s death;</li>
  <li class="number">It were lost sorrow to wail one that’s lost.</li>

<ol data-speaker="EDW.">
  <li class="number">Then you conclude, my grandam, he is dead.</li>
  <li class="number">The King mine uncle is to blame for it.</li>

  <li class="number">Told me the King, provok’d to it by the Queen,</li>
  <li class="number">Devis’d impeachments to imprison him;</li>
  <li class="number">And when my uncle told me so, he wept,</li>
  <li class="number">And pitied me, and kindly kiss’d my cheek;</li>
  <li class="number">Bade me rely on him as on my father,</li>
  <li class="number">And he would love me dearly as a child.</li>

<ol data-speaker="DUCH.">

<ol data-speaker="DUCH.">
  <li class="number">I long with all my heart to see the Prince.</li>

  <li class="number">Ay, mother, but I would not have it so.</li>

<ol data-speaker="DUCH.">
  <li class="number">Why, my good cousin, it is good to grow.</li>

<ol data-speaker="YORK.">
  <li class="number">Grandam, one night as we did sit at supper,</li>
  <li class="number">My uncle Rivers talk’d how I did grow</li>
  <li class="number">More than my brother. “Ay,” quoth my uncle Gloucester,</li>
  <li class="number">“Small herbs have grace, great weeds do grow apace.”</li>
  <li class="number">And since, methinks I would not grow so fast,</li>
  <li class="number">Because sweet flow’rs are slow and weeds make haste.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUCH.">
  <li class="number">Good faith, good faith, the saying did not hold</li>
  <li class="number">In him that did object the same to thee:</li>
  <li class="number">He was the wretched’st thing when he was young,</li>
  <li class="number">So long a-growing and so leisurely</li>
  <li class="number">That if his rule were true, he should be gracious.</li>

<ol data-speaker="ARCH.">
  <li class="number">And so no doubt he is, my gracious madam.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUCH.">
  <li class="number">I hope he is, but yet let mothers doubt.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="YORK.">
  <li class="number">Now by my troth, if I had been rememb’red,</li>
  <li class="number">I could have given my uncle’s Grace a flout,</li>
  <li class="number">To touch his growth nearer than he touch’d mine.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUCH.">
  <li class="number">How, my young York? I prithee let me hear it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="YORK.">
  <li class="number">Marry (they say) my uncle grew so fast</li>
  <li class="number">That he could gnaw a crust at two hours old;</li>
  <li class="number">’Twas full two years ere I could get a tooth.</li>
  <li class="number">Grandam, this would have been a biting jest.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DUCH.">
  <li class="number">I prithee, pretty York, who told thee this?</li>

  <li class="number">No, uncle, but our crosses on the way</li>

  <li class="number">Sweet Prince, the untainted virtue of your years</li>

  <li class="number">Those uncles which you want were dangerous;</li>
  <li class="number">Your Grace attended to their sug’red words,</li>

<ol data-speaker="HAST.">
  <li class="number">On what occasion, God he knows, not I,</li>
  <li class="number">The Queen your mother and your brother York</li>
  <li class="number">Have taken sanctuary. The tender Prince</li>
  <li class="number">Would fain have come with me to meet your Grace,</li>
  <li class="number">But by his mother was perforce withheld.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BUCK.">
  <li class="number">Fie, what an indirect and peevish course</li>

  <li class="number">Unto his princely brother presently?</li>

  <li class="number">My Lord of Buckingham, if my weak oratory</li>

  <li class="number">To mild entreaties, God in heaven forbid</li>
  <li class="number">We should infringe the holy privilege</li>

  <li class="number">The benefit thereof is always granted</li>

  <li class="number">This prince hath neither claim’d it nor deserv’d it,</li>

  <li class="number">Then taking him from thence that is not there,</li>
  <li class="number">You break no privilege nor charter there.</li>

<ol data-speaker="STAN. MESS.">
  <li class="number">Then certifies your lordship that this night</li>
  <li class="number">He dreamt the boar had rased off his helm.</li>
  <li class="number">Besides, he says there are two Councils kept;</li>
  <li class="number">And that may be determin’d at the one</li>
  <li class="number">Which may make you and him to rue at th’ other.</li>
  <li class="number">Therefore he sends to know your lordship’s pleasure,</li>

  <li class="number">And for his dreams, I wonder he’s so simple</li>
  <li class="number">To trust the mock’ry of unquiet slumbers.</li>
  <li class="number">To fly the boar before the boar pursues</li>
  <li class="number">Were to incense the boar to follow us,</li>
  <li class="number">And make pursuit where he did mean no chase.</li>
  <li class="number">Go, bid thy master rise and come to me,</li>

<ol data-speaker="HAST.">
  <li class="number">Indeed I am no mourner for that news,</li>

  <li class="number">Well, Catesby, ere a fortnight make me older,</li>
  <li class="number">I’ll send some packing that yet think not on’t.</li>

<ol data-speaker="CATE.">

  <li class="number">Tongue-tied ambition, not replying, yielded</li>
  <li class="number">To bear the golden yoke of sovereignty,</li>
  <li class="number">Which fondly you would here impose on me.</li>
  <li class="number">If to reprove you for this suit of yours,</li>

  <li class="number">Definitively thus I answer you:</li>
  <li class="number">Your love deserves my thanks, but my desert</li>

  <li class="number">And in the vapor of my glory smother’d.</li>
  <li class="number">But God be thank’d, there is no need of me,</li>
  <li class="number">And much I need to help you, were there need:</li>
  <li class="number">The royal tree hath left us royal fruit,</li>
  <li class="number">Which mellow’d by the stealing hours of time,</li>
  <li class="number">Will well become the seat of majesty,</li>
  <li class="number">And make (no doubt) us happy by his reign.</li>
  <li class="number">On him I lay that you would lay on me,</li>

  <li class="number">My lord, this argues conscience in your Grace,</li>

  <li class="number">You say that Edward is your brother’s son:</li>

  <li class="number">And afterward by substitute betroth’d</li>
  <li class="number">To Bona, sister to the King of France.</li>
  <li class="number">These both put off, a poor petitioner,</li>
  <li class="number">A care-craz’d mother to a many sons,</li>
  <li class="number">A beauty-waning and distressed widow,</li>
  <li class="number">Even in the afternoon of her best days,</li>
  <li class="number">Made prize and purchase of his wanton eye,</li>
  <li class="number">Seduc’d the pitch and height of his degree</li>
  <li class="number">To base declension and loath’d bigamy.</li>
  <li class="number">By her, in his unlawful bed, he got</li>
  <li class="number">This Edward, whom our manners call the Prince.</li>
  <li class="number">More bitterly could I expostulate,</li>
  <li class="number">Save that for reverence to some alive,</li>
  <li class="number">I give a sparing limit to my tongue.</li>
  <li class="number">Then, good my lord, take to your royal self</li>
  <li class="number">This proffer’d benefit of dignity;</li>

  <li class="number">If I have kill’d the issue of your womb,</li>

  <li class="number">Go then, my mother, to thy daughter go,</li>

  <li class="number">Prepare her ears to hear a wooer’s tale;</li>
  <li class="number">Put in her tender heart th’ aspiring flame</li>
  <li class="number">Of golden sovereignty; acquaint the Princess</li>
  <li class="number">With the sweet silent hours of marriage joys;</li>
  <li class="number">And when this arm of mine hath chastised</li>
