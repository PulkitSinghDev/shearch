<h3>Scene 1</h3>

<h4>Venice. A street.</h4>

<div class="stage-direction">
	Enter Roderigo and Iago.
	
		ROD.
		IAGO.
	
</div>

<ol data-speaker="ROD.">
  <li class="number">Tush, never tell me! I take it much unkindly</li>
  <li class="number">That thou, Iago, who hast had my purse</li>
  <li class="number">As if the strings were thine, shouldst know of this.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO.">
  <li class="number">’Sblood, but you’ll not hear me.</li>
  <li class="number">If ever I did dream of such a matter,</li>
  <li class="number">Abhor me.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROD.">
  <li class="number">Thou toldst me thou didst hold him in thy hate.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO.">
  <li class="number">Despise me</li>
  <li class="number">If I do not. Three great ones of the city,</li>
  <li class="number">In personal suit to make me his lieutenant,</li>
  <li class="number">Off-capp’d to him; and, by the faith of man,</li>
  <li class="number">I know my price, I am worth no worse a place.</li>
  <li class="number">But he (as loving his own pride and purposes)</li>
  <li class="number">Evades them with a bombast circumstance</li>
  <li class="number">Horribly stuff’d with epithites of war,</li>
  <li class="number">And in conclusion,</li>
  <li class="number">Nonsuits my mediators; for, “Certes,” says he,</li>
  <li class="number">“I have already chose my officer.”</li>
  <li class="number">And what was he?</li>
  <li class="number">Forsooth, a great arithmetician,</li>
  <li class="number">One Michael Cassio, a Florentine</li>
  <li class="number">(A fellow almost damn’d in a fair wife),</li>
  <li class="number">That never set a squadron in the field,</li>
  <li class="number">Nor the division of a battle knows</li>
  <li class="number">More than a spinster—unless the bookish theoric,</li>
  <li class="number">Wherein the toged consuls can propose</li>
  <li class="number">As masterly as he. Mere prattle, without practice,</li>
  <li class="number">Is all his soldiership. But he, sir, had th’ election;</li>
  <li class="number">And I, of whom his eyes had seen the proof</li>
  <li class="number">At Rhodes, at Cyprus, and on other grounds</li>
  <li class="number">Christen’d and heathen, must be belee’d and calm’d</li>
  <li class="number">By debitor and creditor—this counter—caster,</li>
  <li class="number">He (in good time!) must his lieutenant be,</li>
  <li class="number">And I (God bless the mark!) his Moorship’s ancient.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROD.">
  <li class="number">By heaven, I rather would have been his hangman.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO.">
  <li class="number">Why, there’s no remedy. ’Tis the curse of service;</li>
  <li class="number">Preferment goes by letter and affection,</li>
  <li class="number">And not by old gradation, where each second</li>
  <li class="number">Stood heir to th’ first. Now, sir, be judge yourself</li>
  <li class="number">Whether I in any just term am affin’d</li>
  <li class="number">To love the Moor.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROD.">
  <li class="number">I would not follow him then.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO.">
  <li class="number">O, sir, content you;</li>
  <li class="number">I follow him to serve my turn upon him.</li>
  <li class="number">We cannot all be masters, nor all masters</li>
  <li class="number">Cannot be truly follow’d. You shall mark</li>
  <li class="number">Many a duteous and knee-crooking knave</li>
  <li class="number">That (doting on his own obsequious bondage)</li>
  <li class="number">Wears out his time, much like his master’s ass,</li>
  <li class="number">For nought but provender, and when he’s old, cashier’d.</li>
  <li class="number">Whip me such honest knaves. Others there are</li>
  <li class="number">Who, trimm’d in forms and visages of duty,</li>
  <li class="number">Keep yet their hearts attending on themselves,</li>
  <li class="number">And throwing but shows of service on their lords,</li>
  <li class="number">Do well thrive by them; and when they have lin’d their coats,</li>
  <li class="number">Do themselves homage. These fellows have some soul,</li>
  <li class="number">And such a one do I profess myself. For, sir,</li>
  <li class="number">It is as sure as you are Roderigo,</li>
  <li class="number">Were I the Moor, I would not be Iago.</li>
  <li class="number">In following him, I follow but myself;</li>
  <li class="number">Heaven is my judge, not I for love and duty,</li>
  <li class="number">But seeming so, for my peculiar end;</li>
  <li class="number">For when my outward action doth demonstrate</li>
  <li class="number">The native act and figure of my heart</li>
  <li class="number">In complement extern, ’tis not long after</li>
  <li class="number">But I will wear my heart upon my sleeve</li>
  <li class="number">For daws to peck at: I am not what I am.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROD.">
  <li class="number">What a full fortune does the thick-lips owe</li>
  <li class="number">If he can carry’t thus!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO.">
  <li class="number">Call up her father.</li>
  <li class="number">Rouse him, make after him, poison his delight,</li>
  <li class="number">Proclaim him in the streets; incense her kinsmen,</li>
  <li class="number">And though he in a fertile climate dwell,</li>
  <li class="number">Plague him with flies. Though that his joy be joy,</li>
  <li class="number">Yet throw such changes of vexation on’t,</li>
  <li class="number">As it may lose some color.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROD.">
  <li class="number">Here is her father’s house, I’ll call aloud.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO.">
  <li class="number">Do, with like timorous accent and dire yell</li>
  <li class="number">As when, by night and negligence, the fire</li>
  <li class="number">Is spied in populous cities.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROD.">

  <li class="number">In honest plainness thou hast heard me say</li>
  <li class="number">My daughter is not for thee; and now, in madness</li>
  <li class="number">(Being full of supper and distemp’ring draughts),</li>
  <li class="number">Upon malicious bravery dost thou come</li>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO.">
  <li class="number">’Zounds, sir, you are one of those that will not serve God, if the devil bid you. Because we come to do you service, and you think we are ruffians, you’ll have your daughter cover’d with a Barbary horse, you’ll have your nephews neigh to you; you’ll have coursers for cousins, and gennets for germans.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BRA.">
  <li class="number">What profane wretch art thou?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO.">
  <li class="number">I am one, sir, that comes to tell you your daughter and the Moor are now making the beast with two backs.</li>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO.">
  <li class="number">You are a senator.</li>

<ol data-speaker="BRA.">
  <li class="number">This thou shalt answer; I know thee, Roderigo.</li>

  <li class="number">Sir, I will answer any thing. But I beseech you,</li>
  <li class="number">If’t be your pleasure and most wise consent</li>
  <li class="number">(As partly I find it is) that your fair daughter,</li>
  <li class="number">At this odd-even and dull watch o’ th’ night,</li>
  <li class="number">Transported with no worse nor better guard</li>
  <li class="number">But with a knave of common hire, a gundolier,</li>
  <li class="number">To the gross clasps of a lascivious Moor—</li>
  <li class="number">If this be known to you, and your allowance,</li>
  <li class="number">We then have done you bold and saucy wrongs;</li>
  <li class="number">But if you know not this, my manners tell me</li>
  <li class="number">We have your wrong rebuke. Do not believe</li>
  <li class="number">That, from the sense of all civility,</li>
  <li class="number">I thus would play and trifle with your reverence.</li>
  <li class="number">Your daughter (if you have not given her leave),</li>
  <li class="number">I say again, hath made a gross revolt,</li>
  <li class="number">Tying her duty, beauty, wit, and fortunes</li>
  <li class="number">In an extravagant and wheeling stranger</li>
  <li class="number">Of here and every where. Straight satisfy yourself.</li>
  <li class="number">If she be in her chamber or your house,</li>
  <li class="number">Let loose on me the justice of the state</li>
  <li class="number">For thus deluding you.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="BRA.">
  <li class="number">Strike on the tinder, ho!</li>
  <li class="number">Give me a taper! Call up all my people!</li>

  <li class="number">It seems not meet, nor wholesome to my place,</li>
  <li class="number">To be producted (as, if I stay, I shall)</li>
  <li class="number">Against the Moor; for I do know the state</li>
  <li class="number">(How ever this may gall him with some check)</li>
  <li class="number">Cannot with safety cast him, for he’s embark’d</li>
  <li class="number">With such loud reason to the Cyprus wars</li>
  <li class="number">(Which even now stands in act) that, for their souls,</li>
  <li class="number">Another of his fathom they have none</li>
  <li class="number">To lead their business; in which regard,</li>
  <li class="number">Though I do hate him as I do hell-pains,</li>
  <li class="number">Yet, for necessity of present life,</li>
  <li class="number">I must show out a flag and sign of love,</li>
  <li class="number">Which is indeed but sign. That you shall surely find him,</li>

  <li class="number">My very noble and approv’d good masters:</li>
  <li class="number">That I have ta’en away this old man’s daughter,</li>
  <li class="number">It is most true; true I have married her;</li>
  <li class="number">The very head and front of my offending</li>
  <li class="number">Hath this extent, no more. Rude am I in my speech,</li>
  <li class="number">And little bless’d with the soft phrase of peace;</li>
  <li class="number">For since these arms of mine had seven years’ pith,</li>
  <li class="number">Till now some nine moons wasted, they have us’d</li>
  <li class="number">Their dearest action in the tented field;</li>
  <li class="number">And little of this great world can I speak</li>
  <li class="number">More than pertains to feats of broils and battle,</li>
  <li class="number">And therefore little shall I grace my cause</li>
  <li class="number">In speaking for myself. Yet (by your gracious patience)</li>
  <li class="number">I will a round unvarnish’d tale deliver</li>
  <li class="number">Of my whole course of love—what drugs, what charms,</li>
  <li class="number">What conjuration, and what mighty magic</li>
  <li class="number">(For such proceeding I am charg’d withal)</li>
  <li class="number">I won his daughter.</li>

<ol data-speaker="BRA.">
  <li class="number">A maiden, never bold;</li>

  <li class="number">Blush’d at herself; and she, in spite of nature,</li>
  <li class="number">Of years, of country, credit, every thing,</li>
  <li class="number">To fall in love with what she fear’d to look on!</li>
  <li class="number">It is a judgment main’d, and most imperfect,</li>

  <li class="number">Against all rules of nature, and must be driven</li>
  <li class="number">To find out practices of cunning hell</li>
  <li class="number">Why this should be. I therefore vouch again</li>
  <li class="number">That with some mixtures pow’rful o’er the blood,</li>

  <li class="number">He wrought upon her.</li>

  <li class="number">Of being taken by the insolent foe</li>

  <li class="number">That I would all my pilgrimage dilate,</li>
  <li class="number">Whereof by parcels she had something heard,</li>
  <li class="number">But not intentively. I did consent,</li>
  <li class="number">And often did beguile her of her tears,</li>
  <li class="number">When I did speak of some distressful stroke</li>
  <li class="number">That my youth suffer’d. My story being done,</li>
  <li class="number">She gave me for my pains a world of sighs;</li>
  <li class="number">She swore, in faith ’twas strange, ’twas passing strange;</li>
  <li class="number">’Twas pitiful, ’twas wondrous pitiful.</li>
  <li class="number">She wish’d she had not heard it, yet she wish’d</li>
  <li class="number">That heaven had made her such a man. She thank’d me,</li>
  <li class="number">And bade me, if I had a friend that lov’d her,</li>
  <li class="number">I should but teach him how to tell my story,</li>
  <li class="number">And that would woo her. Upon this hint I spake:</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROD.">
  <li class="number">It is silliness to live, when to live is torment; and then have we a prescription to die, when death is our physician.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO.">
  <li class="number">O villainous! I have look’d upon the world for four times seven years, and since I could distinguish betwixt a benefit and an injury, I never found man that knew how to love himself. Ere I would say I would drown myself for the love of a guinea hen, I would change my humanity with a baboon.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROD.">
  <li class="number">What should I do? I confess it is my shame to be so fond, but it is not in my virtue to amend it.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO.">
  <li class="number">Virtue? A fig! ’Tis in ourselves that we are thus or thus. Our bodies are our gardens, to the which our wills are gardeners; so that if we will plant nettles or sow lettuce, set hyssop and weed up tine, supply it with one gender of herbs or distract it with many, either to have it sterile with idleness or manur’d with industry—why, the power and corrigible authority of this lies in our wills. If the beam of our lives had not one scale of reason to poise another of sensuality, the blood and baseness of our natures would conduct us to most prepost’rous conclusions. But we have reason to cool our raging motions, our carnal stings, our unbitted lusts; whereof I take this that you call love to be a sect or scion.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROD.">
  <li class="number">It cannot be.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO.">
  <li class="number">It is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of the will. Come, be a man! Drown thyself? Drown cats and blind puppies! I have profess’d me thy friend, and I confess me knit to thy deserving with cables of perdurable toughness. I could never better stead thee than now. Put money in thy purse; follow thou the wars; defeat thy favor with an usurp’d beard. I say put money in thy purse. It cannot be long that Desdemona should continue her love to the Moor—put money in thy purse—nor he his to her. It was a violent commencement in her, and thou shalt see an answerable sequestration—put but money in thy purse. These Moors are changeable in their wills—fill thy purse with money. The food that to him now is as luscious as locusts, shall be to him shortly as acerb as the coloquintida. She must change for youth; when she is sated with his body, she will find the error of her choice. She must have change, she must; therefore put money in thy purse. If thou wilt needs damn thyself, do it a more delicate way than drowning. Make all the money thou canst. If sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt an erring barbarian and a super-subtle Venetian be not too hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell, thou shalt enjoy her; therefore make money. A pox of drowning thyself, it is clean out of the way. Seek thou rather to be hang’d in compassing thy joy than to be drown’d and go without her.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROD.">
  <li class="number">Wilt thou be fast to my hopes, if I depend on the issue?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO.">
  <li class="number">Thou art sure of me—go make money. I have told thee often, and I retell thee again and again, I hate the Moor. My cause is hearted; thine hath no less reason. Let us be conjunctive in our revenge against him. If thou canst cuckold him, thou dost thyself a pleasure, me a sport. There are many events in the womb of time which will be deliver’d. Traverse, go, provide thy money. We will have more of this tomorrow. <foreign xml:lang="fr">Adieu</foreign>.</li>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO.">
  <li class="number">Lay thy finger thus; and let thy soul be instructed. Mark me with what violence she first lov’d the Moor, but for bragging and telling her fantastical lies. To love him still for prating—let not thy discreet heart think it. Her eye must be fed; and what delight shall she have to look on the devil? When the blood is made dull with the act of sport, there should be, again to inflame it and to give satiety a fresh appetite, loveliness in favor, sympathy in years, manners, and beauties—all which the Moor is defective in. Now for want of these requir’d conveniences, her delicate tenderness will find itself abus’d, begin to heave the gorge, disrelish and abhor the Moor; very nature will instruct her in it and compel her to some second choice. Now, sir, this granted (as it is a most pregnant and unforc’d position), who stands so eminent in the degree of this fortune as Cassio does? A knave very voluble; no further conscionable than in putting on the mere form of civil and humane seeming, for the better compass of his salt and most hidden loose affection? Why, none, why, none—a slipper and subtle knave, a finder-out of occasion; that has an eye can stamp and counterfeit advantages, though true advantage never present itself; a devilish knave. Besides, the knave is handsome, young, and hath all those requisites in him that folly and green minds look after; a pestilent complete knave, and the woman hath found him already.</li>

  <li class="number">Yes, that I did; but that was but courtesy.</li>

  <li class="number">Lechery, by this hand; an index and obscure prologue to the history of lust and foul thoughts. They met so near with their lips that their breaths embrac’d together. Villainous thoughts, Roderigo! When these mutualities so marshal the way, hard at hand comes the master and main exercise, th’ incorporate conclusion. Pish! But, sir, be you rul’d by me. I have brought you from Venice. Watch you tonight; for the command, I’ll lay’t upon you. Cassio knows you not. I’ll not be far from you. Do you find some occasion to anger Cassio, either by speaking too loud, or tainting his discipline, or from what other course you please, which the time shall more favorably minister.</li>

So shall you have a shorter journey to your desires by the means I shall then have to prefer them; and the impediment most profitably remov’d, without the which there were no expectation of our prosperity.</li>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO.">
  <li class="number">As I am an honest man, I had thought you had receiv’d some bodily wound; there is more sense in that than in reputation. Reputation is an idle and most false imposition; oft got without merit, and lost without deserving. You have lost no reputation at all, unless you repute yourself such a loser. What, man, there are more ways to recover the general again. You are but now cast in his mood, a punishment more in policy than in malice, even so as one would beat his offenseless dog to affright an imperious lion. Sue to him again, and he’s yours.</li>

</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAS.">
  <li class="number">I will ask him for my place again, he shall tell me I am a drunkard! Had I as many mouths as Hydra, such an answer would stop them all.

  <li class="number">You, or any man living, may be drunk at a time, man. I’ll tell you what you shall do. Our general’s wife is now the general—I may say so in this respect, for that he hath devoted and given up himself to the contemplation, mark, and denotement of her parts and graces. Confess yourself freely to her; importune her help to put you in your place again. She is of so free, so kind, so apt, so bless’d a disposition, she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more than she is requested. This broken joint between you and her husband entreat her to splinter; and my fortunes against any lay worth naming, this crack of your love shall grow stronger than it was before.</li>

  <li class="number">What ever shall become of Michael Cassio,</li>
  <li class="number">He’s never any thing but your true servant.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DES.">
  <li class="number">I know’t; I thank you. You do love my lord;</li>
  <li class="number">You have known him long, and be you well assur’d</li>
  <li class="number">He shall in strangeness stand no farther off</li>
  <li class="number">Than in a politic distance.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAS.">
  <li class="number">Ay, but, lady,</li>
  <li class="number">That policy may either last so long,</li>
  <li class="number">Or feed upon such nice and waterish diet,</li>
  <li class="number">Or breed itself so out of circumstances,</li>
  <li class="number">That I being absent and my place supplied,</li>
  <li class="number">My general will forget my love and service.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="DES.">
  <li class="number">Do not doubt that; before Emilia here,</li>
  <li class="number">I give thee warrant of thy place. Assure thee,</li>
  <li class="number">If I do vow a friendship, I’ll perform it</li>
  <li class="number">To the last article. My lord shall never rest,</li>
  <li class="number">I’ll watch him tame, and talk him out of patience;</li>
  <li class="number">His bed shall seem a school, his board a shrift,</li>
  <li class="number">I’ll intermingle every thing he does</li>
  <li class="number">With Cassio’s suit. Therefore be merry, Cassio,</li>
  <li class="number">For thy solicitor shall rather die</li>

  <li class="number">I heard thee say even now, thou lik’st not that,</li>
  <li class="number">When Cassio left my wife. What didst not like?</li>
  <li class="number">And when I told thee he was of my counsel</li>
  <li class="number">In my whole course of wooing, thou criedst, “Indeed!”</li>

  <li class="number">And weigh’st thy words before thou giv’st them breath,</li>
  <li class="number">Therefore these stops of thine fright me the more;</li>
  <li class="number">For such things in a false disloyal knave</li>
  <li class="number">Are tricks of custom; but in a man that’s just</li>
  <li class="number">They’re close dilations, working from the heart,</li>
  <li class="number">That passion cannot rule.</li>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO.">
  <li class="number">For Michael Cassio,</li>

  <li class="number">Ha?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO.">
  <li class="number">O, beware, my lord, of jealousy!</li>
  <li class="number">It is the green-ey’d monster which doth mock</li>
  <li class="number">The meat it feeds on. That cuckold lives in bliss</li>
  <li class="number">Who, certain of his fate, loves not his wronger;</li>
  <li class="number">But O, what damned minutes tells he o’er</li>
  <li class="number">Who dotes, yet doubts; suspects, yet strongly loves!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OTH.">
  <li class="number">O misery!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO.">
  <li class="number">Poor and content is rich, and rich enough,</li>

  <li class="number">Good God, the souls of all my tribe defend</li>
  <li class="number">From jealousy!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OTH.">
  <li class="number">Why? Why is this?</li>
  <li class="number">Think’st thou I’d make a life of jealousy?</li>
  <li class="number">To follow still the changes of the moon</li>
  <li class="number">With fresh suspicions? No! To be once in doubt</li>
  <li class="number">Is once to be resolv’d. Exchange me for a goat,</li>
  <li class="number">When I shall turn the business of my soul</li>
  <li class="number">To such exsufflicate and blown surmises,</li>
  <li class="number">Matching thy inference. ’Tis not to make me jealous</li>
  <li class="number">To say my wife is fair, feeds well, loves company,</li>
  <li class="number">Is free of speech, sings, plays, and dances well;</li>
  <li class="number">Where virtue is, these are more virtuous.</li>
  <li class="number">Nor from mine own weak merits will I draw</li>
  <li class="number">The smallest fear or doubt of her revolt,</li>
  <li class="number">For she had eyes, and chose me. No, Iago,</li>
  <li class="number">I’ll see before I doubt; when I doubt, prove;</li>
  <li class="number">And on the proof, there is no more but this—</li>
  <li class="number">Away at once with love or jealousy!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO.">
  <li class="number">I am glad of this, for now I shall have reason</li>
  <li class="number">To show the love and duty that I bear you</li>
  <li class="number">With franker spirit; therefore (as I am bound)</li>
  <li class="number">Receive it from me. I speak not yet of proof.</li>
  <li class="number">Look to your wife, observe her well with Cassio,</li>
  <li class="number">Wear your eyes thus, not jealous nor secure.</li>
  <li class="number">I would not have your free and noble nature,</li>
  <li class="number">Out of self-bounty, be abus’d; look to’t.</li>
  <li class="number">I know our country disposition well:</li>
  <li class="number">In Venice they do let God see the pranks</li>
  <li class="number">They dare not show their husbands; their best conscience</li>
  <li class="number">Is not to leave’t undone, but keep’t unknown.</li>

<ol data-speaker="OTH.">
  <li class="number">Dost thou say so?</li>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO.">
  <li class="number">Why, now I see there’s mettle in thee, and even from this instant do build on thee a better opinion than ever before. Give me thy hand, Roderigo. Thou hast taken against me a most just exception; but yet I protest I have dealt most directly in thy affair.</li>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO.">
  <li class="number">Sir, there is especial commission come from Venice to depute Cassio in Othello’s place.</li>

<ol data-speaker="ROD.">
  <li class="number">Is that true? Why then Othello and Desdemona return again to Venice.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO.">
  <li class="number">O no; he goes into Mauritania and taketh away with him the fair Desdemona, unless his abode be ling’red here by some accident; wherein none can be so determinate as the removing of Cassio.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROD.">
  <li class="number">How do you mean, removing him?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO.">
  <li class="number">Why, by making him uncapable of Othello’s place: knocking out his brains.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="ROD.">
  <li class="number">And that you would have me to do?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="IAGO.">
  <li class="number">Ay; if you dare do yourself a profit and a right. He sups tonight with a harlotry, and thither will I go to him—he knows not yet of his honorable fortune. If you will watch his going thence (which I will fashion to fall out between twelve and one), you may take him at your pleasure. I will be near to second your attempt, and he shall fall between us. Come, stand not amaz’d at it, but go along with me; I will show you such a necessity in his death that you shall think yourself bound to put it on him. It is now high supper-time, and the night grows to waste. About it.</li>
</ol>

  <li class="number">As husbands have. What is it that they do</li>
  <li class="number">When they change us for others? Is it sport?</li>
  <li class="number">I think it is. And doth affection breed it?</li>

  <li class="number">Found in his pocket too; and this it seems</li>
  <li class="number">Roderigo meant t’ have sent this damned villain;</li>
  <li class="number">But that, belike, Iago in the nick</li>
  <li class="number">Came in and satisfied him.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OTH.">
  <li class="number">O thou pernicious caitiff!—</li>
  <li class="number">How came you, Cassio, by that handkerchief</li>
  <li class="number">That was my wive’s?</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAS.">
  <li class="number">I found it in my chamber:</li>
  <li class="number">And he himself confess’d it but even now,</li>
  <li class="number">That there he dropp’d it for a special purpose</li>
  <li class="number">Which wrought to his desire.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OTH.">
  <li class="number">O fool, fool, fool!</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="CAS.">
  <li class="number">There is besides, in Roderigo’s letter,</li>
  <li class="number">How he upbraids Iago, that he made him</li>
  <li class="number">Brave me upon the watch, whereon it came</li>
  <li class="number">That I was cast; and even but now he spake</li>
  <li class="number">(After long seeming dead) Iago hurt him,</li>
  <li class="number">Iago set him on.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="LOD.">
  <li class="number">You must forsake this room and go with us.</li>
  <li class="number">Your power and your command is taken off,</li>
  <li class="number">And Cassio rules in Cyprus. For this slave,</li>
  <li class="number">If there be any cunning cruelty</li>
  <li class="number">That can torment him much, and hold him long,</li>
  <li class="number">It shall be his. You shall close prisoner rest,</li>
  <li class="number">Till that the nature of your fault be known</li>
  <li class="number">To the Venetian state. Come, bring away.</li>
</ol>

<ol data-speaker="OTH.">
  <li class="number">Soft you; a word or two before you go.</li>
  <li class="number">I have done the state some service, and they know’t—</li>
  <li class="number">No more of that. I pray you, in your letters,</li>
  <li class="number">When you shall these unlucky deeds relate,</li>
  <li class="number">Speak of me as I am; nothing extenuate,</li>
  <li class="number">Nor set down aught in malice. Then must you speak</li>
  <li class="number">Of one that lov’d not wisely but too well;</li>
  <li class="number">Of one not easily jealous, but being wrought,</li>
  <li class="number">Perplexed in the extreme; of one whose hand</li>
  <li class="number">(Like the base Indian) threw a pearl away</li>
  <li class="number">Richer than all his tribe; of one whose subdu’d eyes,</li>
  <li class="number">Albeit unused to the melting mood,</li>
  <li class="number">Drops tears as fast as the Arabian trees</li>
  <li class="number">Their medicinable gum. Set you down this;</li>
  <li class="number">And say besides, that in Aleppo once,</li>
  <li class="number">Where a malignant and a turban’d Turk</li>
  <li class="number">Beat a Venetian and traduc’d the state,</li>
  <li class="number">I took by th’ throat the circumcised dog,</li>
  <li class="number">And smote him—thus.</li>
