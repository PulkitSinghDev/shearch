So, fare thee well.\nNow boast thee, death, in thy possession lies\nA lass unparallel'd. Downy windows, close;\nAnd golden Phoebus never be beheld\nOf eyes again so royal! Your crown's awry;\nI'll mend it, and then play."},{"l":"Ant.5.2","s":"First Guard","t":"Where is the queen?"},{"l":"Ant.5.2","s":"CHARMIAN","t":"Speak softly, wake her not."},{"l":"Ant.5.2","s":"First Guard","t":"Caesar hath sent--"},{"l":"Ant.5.2","s":"CHARMIAN","t":"Too slow a messenger.\nO, come apace, dispatch!

Take up her bed;\nAnd bear her women from the monument:\nShe shall be buried by her Antony:\nNo grave upon the earth shall clip in it\nA pair so famous. High events as these\nStrike those that make them; and their story is\nNo less in pity than his glory which\nBrought them to be lamented. Our army shall\nIn solemn show attend this funeral;\nAnd then to Rome. Come, Dolabella, see\nHigh order in this great solemnity."}]
