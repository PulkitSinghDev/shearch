    GALLUS, PROCULEIUS, and others, his council of war</STAGEDIR>

    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>Go to him, Dolabella, bid him yield;</LINE>
      <LINE>Being so frustrate, tell him he mocks</LINE>
      <LINE>The pauses that he makes.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>

    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>DOLABELLA</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>Caesar, I shall.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>

    <STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>
    <STAGEDIR>Enter DERCETAS, with the sword of MARK ANTONY</STAGEDIR>

    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>Wherefore is that? and what art thou that darest</LINE>
      <LINE>Appear thus to us?</LINE>
    </SPEECH>

    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>DERCETAS</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>I am call'd Dercetas;</LINE>
      <LINE>Mark Antony I served, who best was worthy</LINE>
      <LINE>Best to be served: whilst he stood up and spoke,</LINE>
      <LINE>He was my master; and I wore my life</LINE>
      <LINE>To spend upon his haters. If thou please</LINE>
      <LINE>To take me to thee, as I was to him</LINE>
      <LINE>I'll be to Caesar; if thou pleasest not,</LINE>
      <LINE>I yield thee up my life.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>

    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>What is't thou say'st?</LINE>
    </SPEECH>

    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>DERCETAS</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>I say, O Caesar, Antony is dead.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>

    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>The breaking of so great a thing should make</LINE>
      <LINE>A greater crack: the round world</LINE>
      <LINE>Should have shook lions into civil streets,</LINE>
      <LINE>And citizens to their dens: the death of Antony</LINE>
      <LINE>Is not a single doom; in the name lay</LINE>
      <LINE>A moiety of the world.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>

    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>DERCETAS</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>He is dead, Caesar:</LINE>
      <LINE>Not by a public minister of justice,</LINE>
      <LINE>Nor by a hired knife; but that self hand,</LINE>
      <LINE>Which writ his honour in the acts it did,</LINE>
      <LINE>Hath, with the courage which the heart did lend it,</LINE>
      <LINE>Splitted the heart. This is his sword;</LINE>
      <LINE>I robb'd his wound of it; behold it stain'd</LINE>
      <LINE>With his most noble blood.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>

    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>Look you sad, friends?</LINE>
      <LINE>The gods rebuke me, but it is tidings</LINE>
      <LINE>To wash the eyes of kings.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>

    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>AGRIPPA</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>And strange it is,</LINE>
      <LINE>That nature must compel us to lament</LINE>
      <LINE>Our most persisted deeds.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>

    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>MECAENAS</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>His taints and honours</LINE>
      <LINE>Waged equal with him.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>

    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>AGRIPPA</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>A rarer spirit never</LINE>
      <LINE>Did steer humanity: but you, gods, will give us</LINE>
      <LINE>Some faults to make us men. Caesar is touch'd.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>

    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>MECAENAS</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>When such a spacious mirror's set before him,</LINE>
      <LINE>He needs must see himself.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>

    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>O Antony!</LINE>
      <LINE>I have follow'd thee to this; but we do lance</LINE>
      <LINE>Diseases in our bodies: I must perforce</LINE>
      <LINE>Have shown to thee such a declining day,</LINE>
      <LINE>Or look on thine; we could not stall together</LINE>
      <LINE>In the whole world: but yet let me lament,</LINE>
      <LINE>With tears as sovereign as the blood of hearts,</LINE>
      <LINE>That thou, my brother, my competitor</LINE>
      <LINE>In top of all design, my mate in empire,</LINE>
      <LINE>Friend and companion in the front of war,</LINE>
      <LINE>The arm of mine own body, and the heart</LINE>
      <LINE>Where mine his thoughts did kindle,--that our stars,</LINE>
      <LINE>Unreconciliable, should divide</LINE>
      <LINE>Our equalness to this. Hear me, good friends--</LINE>
      <LINE>But I will tell you at some meeter season:</LINE>
      <STAGEDIR>Enter an Egyptian</STAGEDIR>
      <LINE>The business of this man looks out of him;</LINE>
      <LINE>We'll hear him what he says. Whence are you?</LINE>
    </SPEECH>

    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>Egyptian</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>A poor Egyptian yet. The queen my mistress,</LINE>
      <LINE>Confined in all she has, her monument,</LINE>
      <LINE>Of thy intents desires instruction,</LINE>
      <LINE>That she preparedly may frame herself</LINE>
      <LINE>To the way she's forced to.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>

    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>Bid her have good heart:</LINE>
      <LINE>She soon shall know of us, by some of ours,</LINE>
      <LINE>How honourable and how kindly we</LINE>
      <LINE>Determine for her; for Caesar cannot live</LINE>
      <LINE>To be ungentle.</LINE>
    </SPEECH>

    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>Egyptian</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>So the gods preserve thee!</LINE>

      <SPEAKER>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>Come hither, Proculeius. Go and say,</LINE>
      <LINE>We purpose her no shame: give her what comforts</LINE>
      <LINE>The quality of her passion shall require,</LINE>
      <LINE>Lest, in her greatness, by some mortal stroke</LINE>
      <LINE>She do defeat us; for her life in Rome</LINE>
      <LINE>Would be eternal in our triumph: go,</LINE>
      <LINE>And with your speediest bring us what she says,</LINE>
      <LINE>And how you find of her.</LINE>

      <LINE>Let him alone, for I remember now</LINE>
      <LINE>How he's employ'd: he shall in time be ready.</LINE>
      <LINE>Go with me to my tent; where you shall see</LINE>
      <LINE>How hardly I was drawn into this war;</LINE>
      <LINE>How calm and gentle I proceeded still</LINE>

    <SPEECH>
      <SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
      <LINE>My desolation does begin to make</LINE>
      <LINE>A better life. 'Tis paltry to be Caesar;</LINE>
      <LINE>Not being Fortune, he's but Fortune's knave,</LINE>
      <LINE>A minister of her will: and it is great</LINE>
      <LINE>To do that thing that ends all other deeds;</LINE>
      <LINE>Which shackles accidents and bolts up change;</LINE>
      <LINE>Which sleeps, and never palates more the dug,</LINE>
      <LINE>The beggar's nurse and Caesar's.</LINE>

        <SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>Antony</LINE>
        <LINE>Did tell me of you, bade me trust you; but</LINE>
        <LINE>I do not greatly care to be deceived,</LINE>
        <LINE>That have no use for trusting. If your master</LINE>
        <LINE>Would have a queen his beggar, you must tell him,</LINE>
        <LINE>That majesty, to keep decorum, must</LINE>
        <LINE>No less beg than a kingdom: if he please</LINE>
        <LINE>To give me conquer'd Egypt for my son,</LINE>
        <LINE>He gives me so much of mine own, as I</LINE>
        <LINE>Will kneel to him with thanks.</LINE>

        <LINE>Make your full reference freely to my lord,</LINE>

        <LINE>On all that need: let me report to him</LINE>
        <LINE>Your sweet dependency; and you shall find</LINE>
        <LINE>A conqueror that will pray in aid for kindness,</LINE>
        <LINE>Where he for grace is kneel'd to.</LINE>
      </SPEECH>

      <SPEECH>
        <SPEAKER>CLEOPATRA</SPEAKER>
        <LINE>Pray you, tell him</LINE>
        <LINE>I am his fortune's vassal, and I send him</LINE>
        <LINE>The greatness he has got. I hourly learn</LINE>
        <LINE>A doctrine of obedience; and would gladly</LINE>

        <LINE>You see how easily she may be surprised:</LINE>
        <STAGEDIR>Here PROCULEIUS and two of the Guard ascend the
          monument by a ladder placed against a window, and,
          having descended, come behind CLEOPATRA. Some of

          <LINE>Nor once be chastised with the sober eye</LINE>

          <LINE>Of censuring Rome? Rather a ditch in Egypt</LINE>
          <LINE>Be gentle grave unto me! rather on Nilus' mud</LINE>

          <LINE>The element they lived in: in his livery</LINE>
          <LINE>Walk'd crowns and crownets; realms and islands were</LINE>
